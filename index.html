How do you break the ice?</p> <p>There are five basic steps in starting conversation, which don't always occur in this order. <i>Establish eye contact and smile,</i> then follow this simple procedure.</p> <p></p> <blockquote> 1. <i>Risk versus rejection.</i> Be the first to say hello. <p>2. <i>Ritual questions.</i> Ask easy-to-answer questions about the situation or the other person.</p> <p>3. <i>Active listening.</i> Know what to say next by listening carefully for free information.</p> <p>4. <i>Seek information.</i> Ask information-seeking follow-up questions based on free information <i>you've just heard.</i></p> <p>5. <i>Self-disclosure.</i> Reveal plenty of your free information while asking questions that may interest you personally.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>1. Risk Versus Rejection</b></p> <p>It takes a certain amount of risk to begin a conversation with a stranger. Most shy people don't start conversations because they fear being rejected. Of course, this prevents them from reaching out to others. Remember that risk taking and rejection are part of life, and to be overly sensitive is counterproductive. And, anyway, what's so bad about being rejected by someone you don't even know?</p> <p><b>Change from Passive to Active</b></p> <p>Most shy people take the passive role when it comes to starting conversations. They wait and wait and wait, hoping someone will come along and start a conversation with them. If there are two shy people together, they're both waiting, both taking the passive role. If someone else by chance does start talking, the shy person is often so surprised, she doesn't know what to say.</p> <p>To get out of this "Catch-22," consciously change from the passive to the active role. Be the first to say hello and take the initiative to begin the conversation. Introduce yourself to people regularly and begin to share your ideas, feelings, opinions, and experiences. Look for familiar faces, and after saying hello, seek out other people's thoughts, views, interests, and knowledge. By initiating conversations, you'll get more positive responses, and your fear of rejection will lessen. In this way your risk taking can pay off in making new contacts and having more meaningful conversations.</p> <p>Another advantage of being the first to say hello is that it gives you the opportunity to guide the direction of the conversation, and gives the other person the impression that you are confident, friendly, and open. You are also complimenting the other person by showing a desire to start a conversation with him.</p> <p><b>Minimize Rejections -- Look for Receptivity</b></p> <p>The more you practice starting conversations, the better responses you will get. But, of course, there are going to be some rejections too. No one receives unanimous approval, so when you do get rejected, don't dwell on it. Instead, use it as a lesson and adjust your approach for next time.</p> <p>The best way to minimize rejection is to look for receptivity in those you approach. Try to be sensitive to "where others are at." Look for open arms, eye contact, and a smile. Look for people who are sending receptive signals through their body language, and when you feel the time is right, approach them in a friendly and direct way. For example, if you are at a party or dance, and would like to ask someone for a dance, then look to those who either are dancing or look like they want to dance. Wait for a new song to start playing, and then take the risk. Move closer to the person and establish eye contact, smile, and ask the person for a dance. Chances are she will feel flattered that you have noticed her and hopefully will accept your invitation. If, however, the answer is no, then accept it gracefully with a smile (like water off a duck's back), and ask someone else. Keep asking and you're bound to get an acceptance. The more you ask, the better you'll get at picking out people who will respond the way you want them to.</p> <p><b>How to Accept Rejections</b></p> <p>If you have been rejected many times in your life, then one more rejection isn't going to make much difference. If you're rejected, don't automatically assume it's your fault. The other person may have several reasons for not doing what you are asking him to do; none of it may have anything to do with you. Perhaps the person is busy or not feeling well or genuinely not interested in spending time with you. Rejections are a part of everyday life. Don't let them keep you from reaching out to others. When you begin to get encouraging responses, then you are on the right track. It's all a matter of numbers. Count the positive responses and forget about the rejections.</p> <p>This simple philosophy can help people who fear rejection. If you have only taken a few social risks and have been rejected once or twice, then those rejections loom very large in your life. If, on the other hand, you take more risks, and start conversations, you will receive a mixture of open and closed responses, and each rejection will become less and less meaningful. Focus on the positive responses, and you will get better at choosing receptive people.</p> <p>You really have very little to lose, and a lot to gain. Taking the risk to be the first to say hello isn't such a fearful step. When you take the active role, you are sending this message: "I'm friendly and willing to communicate if you are."</p> <p><b>2. Ask Easy-to-Answer Ritual Questions</b></p> <p>Ritual questions are easy-to-answer requests for information. Although basically requests for personal background or general information, they also convey this message: "I'm interested in getting to know you better."</p> <p><b>Breaking the Ice -- A Compliment or Comment Followed by a Ritual Question</b></p> <p>Ritual questions can be used to break the ice with someone you don't know and wish to speak to. The easiest way to start a conversation with a stranger is to employ one of the three following openings. First, notice something interesting about the person you wish to speak with and, in a friendly and sincere manner, offer a compliment. Quickly follow the compliment with a ritual question that is directly related to the compliment you just gave. The "opening line" might be: "That's a beautiful ring you're wearing! What kind of stone is it?" or "Say, you're a terrific skater! How did you learn to do all those tricks?"</p> <p>A second way to break the ice is to notice something that the person is carrying -- maybe a book, musical instrument, or a piece of sporting equipment. After establishing eye contact and smiling, ask a ritual question based on the object. For example, if you see someone carrying a tennis racket, you could say something like: "Excuse me, but could you recommend a good place to take tennis lessons?" or "Do you know a good place to play without having to wait for a court?" or "I notice you have a racket like the one I'm interested in buying. How do you like it?" or "I see you're a tennis player. I want to start playing. Can you recommend a good racket for a beginner?"</p> <p>If you see someone reading or carrying a book, you can ask how he likes it. If a person has a musical instrument, you can ask him what kind of music he plays, where he plays or studies, how long he has been playing, or how you might get involved. If you see someone taking photographs, you could ask him about the type of camera he has or if he is a professional or amateur photographer. These questions can be applied to almost any object a person is carrying. It is a safe and friendly way of showing someone you've noticed him, while breaking the ice and starting a conversation at the same time.</p> <p>A third way to break the ice and start a conversation is to make a comment or ask a question based on the situation. This can be a request for information like: "Say, excuse me, but I'm looking for an apartment in the neighborhood. Do you happen to know of any places that might be for rent?" Another common question might be: "I'm looking for a good place to eat nearby. Can you recommend a restaurant in the neighborhood?" If you see someone who looks like she needs some assistance, then offering to help is an excellent way to start a conversation. You might say: "You look a little lost. Are you looking for someplace in particular? I live in the neighborhood -- maybe I can help you."</p> <p>In addition to asking for or offering assistance, another way to start a conversation is to make comments based on what you observe. It is best to focus on the positive things you see rather than complaining about the negative. This way you can let others in on the way you see the world, and not get caught in a conversation of "Ain't it a shame!" If you happen to be standing in a movie line, you can comment on other films, or the most recent book you've read if you are browsing in a bookstore. A straight-forward comment you can make is: "I've seen you here before. Do you live or work around here?"</p> <p>Ritual questions are good for breaking the ice and starting a conversation. By looking for what people are involved in, you can easily focus on a topic of interest to the other person. Remember, in addition to finding out about the other person, you are sending this signal: "You seem interesting to me, and I'd like to get to know you better!"</p> <p></p> <blockquote> <b>FAQ</b> <p><i>I dine at a local restaurant where I often see someone else who usually eats alone. How can I ask her if she wants to join me for dinner?</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Make an effort to be seated near the person dining alone, and when she looks in your direction, make eye contact, nod, and smile. If she smiles back, you can say, "Hello. I've noticed that you eat here a lot, too. What's for dinner tonight?" Remember that you are just showing interest and seeing if she ap...</p></p><h2>Ridiculous Favor</h2><p>Life without favor is hard, but God wants to lighten your burden by lavishing His favor on your life.

Hokusai (1760&#x2013;1849) is not only one of the giants of Japanese art and a legend of the Edo period, but also a founding father of Western modernism, whose prolific gamut of prints, illustrations, paintings, and beyond forms one of the most comprehensive oeuvres of ukiyo-e art and a benchmark of japonisme. His influence spread through Impressionism, Art Nouveau, and beyond, enrapturing the likes of Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Edgar Degas, Mary Cassatt, and Vincent van Gogh.</p><p>Hokusai was always a man on the move. He changed domicile more than 90 times during his lifetime and changed his own name through over 30 pseudonyms. In his art, he adopted the same restlessness, covering the complete spectrum of Japanese ukiyo-e,&#x201c;pictures of the floating world&#x201d;, from single-sheet prints of landscapes and actors to erotic books. In addition, he created album prints, illustrations for verse anthologies and historical novels, and surimono, which were privately issued prints for special occasions.</p><p>Hokusai&#x2019;s print series Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji, published between c. 1830 and 1834 is the artist&#x2019;s most renowned work and, with its soaring peak through different seasons and from different vantage points, marked the towering summit of the Japanese landscape print. The series&#x2019; Under the Wave off Kanagawa, also known simply as The Great Wave, is one of the most recognized images of Japanese art in the world.</p><p>This TASCHEN introduction spans the length and breadth of Hokusai&#x2019;s career with key pieces from his far-reaching portfolio. Through these meticulous, majestic works and series, we trace the variety of Hokusai&#x2019;s subjects, from erotic books to historical novels, and the evolution of his vivid formalism and decisive delineation of space through color and line that would go on to liberate Western art from the constraints of its one-point perspective and unleash the modernist momentum.</p></p><p>Rhiannon Paget a fait ses �tudes � l'Universit� des Arts de Tokyo.

In the 1970s she created the food and wine list for Penguin Books. This led to travels in pursuit of food and drink, and a passion to discover the origins of herbs and spices and how they are used. She is acknowledged internationally as an authority on herbs and spices. <i>The Complete Book of Spices</i> won awards in the United States and the United Kingdom, and the first edition of <i>Herbs and Spices</i> was honored by the German Academy of Gastronomy. All of her books have been widely translated. Jill Norman was Elizabeth David's publisher and is now literary trustee of the David estate.More and more herbs and spices appear in American kitchens daily, encouraged by television chefs and promoted through new ethnic cuisines entering the mainstream. Jill Norman's <i>Herbs &amp; Spices</i> comes at exactly the right moment to guide readers through the tangle of leaves, seeds, and berries. Norman thoughtfully organizes herbs into major classifications by their predominant bouquets. This approach immediately assists the cook looking for substitutions. Norman's tasting notes, borrowing a vocabulary identical to that used for wine, establish a standard language for characterizing each item's salient aromas and flavors. Full-color, close-up pictures aid in identification. Text outlines culinary uses and purchasing and storing data and gives information on growing one's own herbs. A short recipe section offers examples of how specific herbs and spices are used in cooking. A directory of mail-order sources further assists those who lack local access. Norman has made a vital contribution to reference collections for quick identification of species and for the use of herbs and spices in cooking. <i>Mark Knoblauch</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

If you have top notch erotica editor Rachel Kramer Bussel, you get The Big Book of Orgasms! This climactic collection captures top erotica writers serving up steamy scenarios all focused on The Big O. Whether getting off from exhibitionism, voyeurism, or a very special pair of blue jeans, the characters in The Big Book of Orgasms explore all sorts of ways they can come. Go "Under the Table" with Elizabeth Coldwell and cheer for "The Pink Team" by Kelly Rand. Discover the thrill of hot wax and even hotter sex; these short stories bring the heat on every page! With a foreword by Ecstasy is Necessary author Barbara Carrellas, these are climaxes you'll want to relive again and again.</p><p>Dr. Ruth once said about Rachel Kramer Bussel, "she is only satisfied if you come and come again." With this rousing read, The Big Book of Orgasms counts all the wonderful ways women get off. Inspirational as well as aspirational, this book celebrates women's sexuality by reaching new heights of excellence. Each of the 69 stories about "the big O" is a peak experience in and of itself.</p></p><p>Introduction: Orgasm Is Just the Beginning<br>As Barbara Carrellas writes, there are so many types of orgasms, more than any single book could cover, but within these pages, you will not only find numerous types of orgasms, as well as the varied characters who experience them, you will also discover different motivations for getting off. Some have a tried and true method, some are willing to take a chance on a new sexual practice--or partner. Some of these characters orgasm frequently; some are aching for the chance to share their body with another person. Some let their orgasms be controlled by a lover; some actively take control of their climaxes.<br>"You amaze me," the nameless protagonist of B.D. Swain's opening story "The Beginning" proclaims. You--readers, authors, orgasmers--amaze me with your boundless sexual hunger and creativity. I've been writing and editing erotica for over a decade, but part of why it never gets old is because of the richness, diversity and nuance I find in the stories that come (no pun intended) my way. They fuel my own imagination and show me that I can always learn more about orgasm, about desire, about sex.<br>The format of 1,200 words or less means these are extremely short stories, but I hope you'll find, like I did, that what they lack in length they make up for in hotness. As with my previous short-short anthology&nbsp;<i>Gotta Have It: 69 Stories of Sudden Sex, </i>all the pieces you hold in your hand, even the shortest ones ("The Park," by Elise Hepner,&nbsp;clocks in at 249 words;&nbsp;"Her Lover Is&nbsp;a&nbsp;Flame," by Cecilia Tan,&nbsp;at 308) offer a snapshot of eroticism that draws you completely into its folds. You might consider each one&nbsp;a teaser, an appetizer, the beginning of a fantasy world you can place yourself into and choose your own orgasmic adventure as you consider where the story might go after the last word printed on the page.<br>Sometimes less is more, and if these stories leave you wanting to see them continued, that's a good thing. They are, like the narrative in Swain's opener states, "just the beginning." Very likely you'll find a type of orgasm, a sex toy, a scenario, a position,&nbsp;or a fantasy you'd like to see represented here that may not be. If so, please write yours and continue the conversation. If your orgasm doesn't look or feel the way these characters' climaxes do, that's perfectly okay. I want to see us expand the possibilities for pleasure, orgasmic and otherwise, not add to the umpteen ways we're told we "should" orgasm or have sex. Just as a physical orgasm, however you define or experience that sensation, doesn't define the end of a sexual encounter, a literary orgasm should not mean you are done interacting with the story. I've re-read these pieces, and the numerous submissions I received for this book, multiple times, and each read offers me something new to consider. I envision&nbsp;<i>The Big Book of Orgasms</i>&nbsp;as one you'll want to revisit, to pick up and read aloud from your favorites to a lover, to keep next to your bed, to tuck into your travel bag.<br>I'm especially pleased to be publishing so many authors in this collection for the first time in one of my anthologies. There is a power and depth to these voices that I hope resonates with you.<br>Rachel Kramer Bussel<br>New York City<b>Ecstatic Passion</b><br><br>Dr. Ruth once said legendary editor Rachel Kramer Bussel "is only satisfied if you come and come again." Bussel, the editor of the bestsellers <i>Orgasmic</i> and <i>Gotta Have It</i>, has captured 69 top erotica writers serving up steamy scenarios all focused on the Big O. The characters in <i>The Big Book of Orgasms</i> have fun exploring their desires and reaching new depths of pleasure with lovers who range from sweet to sweetly kinky.<br><br>A man's sexy strut incites a woman to take matters "In Her Hands" in Tenille Brown's story, while the narrator of Emerald's "Payback" rekindles an old flame and ignites a spectacular passion. Bussel's own searing "I'm on Fire" reveals all the pleasures to be gained through obedience. These are climaxes you'll want to relive more than once.</p><h2>A Guide Book of Morgan Silver Dollars (Whitman Publishing, Llc) (Bowers Series)</h2><p>In the sixth edition of A Guide Book of Morgan Silver<p> Dollars, Q.

The book starts with author Jessica Julius describing the movie's original story pitch - a 1960s spy story - and how it evolved over four years into the modern day tale of underdogs, prejudice, and fighting for justice for all. She gives us the scoop on how the characters were developed (balancing a feminine yet tough, na�ve yet sharp, optimistic yet challenged bunny cop isn't so easy!), shows us amazing "sets" I don't even remember in the fast-moving film, and she lets us in on all kinds of fun details, like the fact that it took eight months to get the various animals' fur just right (color, texture, and direction of fur growth takes more contemplation than I realized). We are also privy to many sketches and scenes that were eventually cut from the film...<i>The Art of Zootopia</i> is both a captivating companion book to the movie, as well as a stand-alone coffee table book that doesn't need any knowledge of the movie to be appreciated." <br>-Wink Books</p><h2>Good Night Trains (Good Night Our World)</h2><p>Good Night Trains highlights steam locomotives, freight trains, box cars, cog railroads, mine trains, subways, monorails, sleeper trains, high-speed trains, holiday trains, snow-plow trains, Christmas trains, and more.

Rhyming verses tell the tale of the hapless farmer as he watches his animals gobble up his shining apples. The whole barnyard emerges one by one, from mighty horse to tiny hen, to sample the succulent fruit, emitting their distinctive calls when they&#x2019;re through. &#x201c;Duck came and ate one, / pick, pick, pick. / Quack, quack, fiddle-dee-fee.&#x201d; Each time a piece of fruit is consumed, the farmer counts the remaining apples, beseeching the animals to leave one for him. Every number has its own two-page spread, with the featured numeral in oversized red text and the appropriate number of apples lined up next to it. Hutchins&#x2019;s (Pink Pig, 1994) exuberant verses will have children chanting the refrain &#x201c;fiddle-dee-fee&#x201d; along with the farmer. Her vivid illustrations dazzle the eye with brilliant colors. A red outer border frames the pictures, which contain a festive row of sunny yellow flowers, running along the top and bottom of the page. The characters, both animal and human, resemble brightly colored wooden toys&#x2014;as if a child&#x2019;s toy set had suddenly become animated. The illustrated end pages provide additional counting practice for readers; counting up to ten on one side and down to one on the facing page. A welcome addition to the counting-book genre, Hutchins&#x2019;s playful tale is an edifying and energetic romp. (Picture book. 3-5) -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

Additionally, I love to write about my knowledge of hunting black bear, to tell my bear calling stories in a rich manner and most importantly, to teach how to hunt black bears, to those who want to put the time and effort into pursuing and conserving this wonderful, powerful and at times vicious predator. You are much more likely to find me on top of a stump pile with a predator call in my mouth, alone, in the quiet solitude of a mountain valley than most other places. After all, hunting is what we are designed to do.My goal in writing&nbsp;<i>The Ultimate Guide To Black&nbsp;Bear Hunting</i>&nbsp;was to write just that.&nbsp;I want&nbsp;to educate as best I can on how to hunt black bears, while keeping it entertaining both visually and through story telling. Not to mention, in the book,&nbsp;I add&nbsp;plenty of bear hunting gold nuggets that are actually useful!

Little Frog tells her she&#x2019;s not looking long enough, and he&#x2019;s right.</p><p>Goethe (1749-1832) is celebrated as a great German poet, novelist, and philosopher. But in his eyes, color theory was his most significant achievement. In 1810 Goethe published <i>Farbenlehre</i>, naming three primary colors--red, blue, and yellow--from which all other colors could be made, and claiming that each color had an opposite, or complementary, color. But how does this relate to well-loved artist Eric Carle's <i>Hello, Red Fox</i>? Well, it's like this. On his special birthday, Little Frog's friends--Red Fox, Purple Butterfly, Orange Cat, and others--begin to arrive at his house for a party. Imagine Mama Frog's surprise when she perceives Red Fox as green, Purple Butterfly as yellow, and so on. Each time, Little Frog gently points out that she simply hasn't stared at each animal long enough to see his or her "true color."<p> At the beginning of the book, readers are instructed to stare for ten seconds at the boldly colored animal on the left side of the spread, then transfer their unblinking gaze (more like glaze at this point) to the blank white page on the right. If they do that successfully, a shadowy image of the animal appears in its complementary color! Young kids may think this is magic, but actually the phenomenon taking place between the eye and the brain is called "simultaneous contrast after-image." No matter what you call it, it's amazing and fun to behold! The story itself is simple and deliberately repetitive, appealing to very young children, but the optical illusions will be a hit with all ages. Carle's bold collage illustrations are perfect for this playful spin around the color wheel, which ends with the green Little Frog turning red when Mama Frog kisses him in front of all of his friends.

For Aron Ralston, a twenty-seven-year-old mountaineer and outdoorsman, a walk into the remote Blue John Canyon was a chance to get a break from a winter of solo climbing Colorado's highest and toughest peaks. He'd earned this weekend vacation, and though he met two charming women along the way, by early afternoon he finally found himself in his element: alone, with just the beauty of the natural world all around him.<br> <br>It was 2:41 P.M. Eight miles from his truck, in a deep and narrow slot canyon, Aron was climbing down off a wedged boulder when the rock suddenly, and terrifyingly, came loose. Before he could get out of the way, the falling stone pinned his right hand and wrist against the canyon wall.<br> <br>And so began six days of hell for Aron Ralston. With scant water and little food, no jacket for the painfully cold nights, and the terrible knowledge that he'd told no one where he was headed, he found himself facing a lingering death -- trapped by an 800-pound boulder 100 feet down in the bottom of a canyon. As he eliminated his escape options one by one through the days, Aron faced the full horror of his predicament: By the time any possible search and rescue effort would begin, he'd most probably have died of dehydration, if a flash flood didn't drown him before that.<br> <br>What does one do in the face of almost certain death? Using the video camera from his pack, Aron began recording his grateful good-byes to his family and friends all over the country, thinking back over a life filled with adventure, and documenting a last will and testament with the hope that someone would find it. (For their part, his family and friends had instigated a major search for Aron, the amazing details of which are also documented here for the first time.) The knowledge of their love kept Aron Ralston alive, until a divine inspiration on Thursday morning solved the riddle of the boulder. Aron then committed the most extreme act imaginable to save himself.<br> <br><i>Between a Rock and a Hard Place</i> -- a brilliantly written, funny, honest, inspiring, and downright astonishing report from the line where death meets life -- will surely take its place in the annals of classic adventure stories.</p><p>Aron Ralston, a native of the Midwest, retired from a career as a mechanical engineer at age twenty-six before moving to Aspen, Colorado. Since his accident, he has completed his unprecedented project to climb the fifty-nine Colorado peaks of more than 14,000 feet, alone, in winter. His first book, <i>Between a Rock and a Hard Place</i>, was a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller and was adapted into the major motion picture <i>127 Hours</i> by Danny Boyle. Today, as a father of an infant daughter and four-year-old son, Aron&nbsp;lives in Boulder, Colorado.&nbsp;He continues to&nbsp;travel the world for both adventure and&nbsp;to share his story.&nbsp;Follow his journey at AronRalstonSpeaker.com.Between a Rock and a Hard Place ONE<p></p> &#x201c;Geologic Time Includes Now&#x201d;<p></p> <br>This is the most beautiful place on earth.<br> <br>There are many such places. Every man, every woman, carries in heart and mind the image of the ideal place, known or unknown, actual or visionary.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There&#x2019;s no limit to the human capacity for the homing sentiment. Theologians, sky pilots, astronauts have even felt the appeal of home calling to them from up above, in the cold black outback of interstellar space.<br> <br>For myself I&#x2019;ll take Moab, Utah. I don&#x2019;t mean the town itself, of course, but the country which surrounds it&#x2014;the canyonlands. The slickrock desert. The red dust and the burnt cliffs and the lonely sky&#x2014;all that which lies beyond the end of the roads.<br> <br>&#x2014;EDWARD ABBEY, Desert Solitaire<br> <br>FRAYING CONTRAILS STREAK another bluebird sky above the red desert plateau, and I wonder how many sunburnt days these badlands have seen since their creation. It&#x2019;s Saturday morning, April 26, 2003, and I am mountain biking by myself on a scraped dirt road in the far southeastern corner of Emery County, in central-eastern Utah. An hour ago, I left my truck at the dirt trailhead parking area for Horseshoe Canyon, the isolated geographic window of Canyonlands National Park that sits fifteen air miles northwest of the legendary Maze District, forty miles southeast of the great razorback uplift of the San Rafael Swell, twenty miles west of the Green River, and some forty miles south of I-70, that corridor of commerce and last chances (NEXT SERVICES: 110 MILES). With open tablelands to cover for a hundred miles between the snowcapped ranges of the Henrys to the southwest&#x2014;the last range in the U.S. to be named, explored, and mapped&#x2014;and the La Sals to the east, a strong wind is blowing hard from the south, the direction I&#x2019;m heading. Besides slowing my progress to a crawl&#x2014;I&#x2019;m in my lowest gear and pumping hard on a flat grade just to move forward&#x2014;the wind has blown shallow drifts of maroon sand onto the washboarded road. I try to avoid the drifts, but occasionally, they blanket the entire road, and my bike founders. Three times already I&#x2019;ve had to walk through particularly long sand bogs.<br> <br>The going would be much easier if I didn&#x2019;t have this heavy pack on my back. I wouldn&#x2019;t normally carry twenty-five pounds of supplies and equipment on a bike ride, but I&#x2019;m journeying out on a thirty-mile-long circuit of biking and canyoneering&#x2014;traversing the bottom of a deep and narrow canyon system&#x2014;and it will take me most of the day. Besides a gallon of water stored in an insulated three-liter CamelBak hydration pouch and a one-liter Lexan bottle, I have five chocolate bars, two burritos, and a chocolate muffin in a plastic grocery sack in my pack. I&#x2019;ll be hungry by the time I get back to my truck, for certain, but I have enough for the day.<br> <br>The truly burdensome weight comes from my full stock of rappelling gear: three locking carabiners, two regular carabiners, a lightweight combination belay and rappel device, two tied slings of half-inch webbing, a longer length of half-inch webbing with ten prestitched loops called a daisy chain, my climbing harness, a sixty-meter-long and ten-and-a-half-millimeter-thick dynamic climbing rope, twenty-five feet of one-inch tubular webbing, and my rarely used Leatherman-knockoff multi-tool (with two pocketknife blades and a pair of pliers) that I carry in case I need to cut the webbing to build anchors. Also in my backpack are my headlamp, headphones, CD player and several Phish CDs, extra AA batteries, digital camera and mini digital video camcorder, and their batteries and protective cloth sacks.<br> <br>It adds up, but I deem it all necessary, even the camera gear. I enjoy photographing the otherworldly colors and shapes presented in the convoluted depths of slot canyons and the prehistoric artwork preserved in their alcoves. This trip will have the added bonus of taking me past four archaeological sites in Horseshoe Canyon that are home to hundreds of petroglyphs and pictographs. The U.S. Congress added the isolated canyon to the otherwise contiguous Canyonlands National Park specifically to protect the five-thousand-year-old etchings and paintings found along the Barrier Creek watercourse at the bottom of Horseshoe, a silent record of an ancient people&#x2019;s presence. At the Great Gallery, dozens of eight-to-ten-foot-high superhumans hover en echelon over groups of indistinct animals, dominating beasts and onlookers alike with their long, dark bodies, broad shoulders, and haunting eyes. The superbly massive apparitions are the oldest and best examples of their design type in the world, such preeminent specimens that anthropologists have named the heavy and somewhat sinister artistic mode of their creators the &#x201c;Barrier Creek style.&#x201d; Though there is no written record to help us decipher the artists&#x2019; meaning, a few of the figures appear to be hunters with spears and clubs; most of them, legless, armless, and horned, seem to float like nightmarish demons. Whatever their intended significance, the mysterious forms are remarkable for their ability to carry a declaration of ego across the millennia and confront the modern observer with the fact that the panels have survived longer and are in better condition than all but the oldest golden artifacts of Western civilization. This provokes the question: What will remain of today&#x2019;s ostensibly advanced societies five thousand years hence? Probably not our artwork. Nor any evidence of our record amounts of leisure time (if for no other reason than most of us fritter away this luxury in front of our television sets).<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>In anticipation of the wet and muddy conditions in the canyon, I&#x2019;m wearing a pair of beat-up running shoes and thick wool-blend socks. Thus insulated, my feet sweat as they pump on my bike pedals. My legs sweat, too, compressed by the Lycra biking shorts I&#x2019;m wearing beneath my beige nylon shorts. Even through double-thick padding, my bike seat pummels my rear end. Up top, I have on a favorite Phish T-shirt and a blue baseball cap. I left my waterproof jacket back at my truck; the day is going to be warm and dry, just like it was yesterday when I biked the twelve-mile loop of the Slick Rock Trail over east of Moab. If it were going to be rainy, a slot canyon would be the last place I&#x2019;d be headed, jacket or no.<br> <br>Lightweight travel is a pleasure to me, and I&#x2019;ve figured how to do more with less so I can go farther in a given amount of time. Yesterday I had just my small CamelBak with a few bike-repair items and my cameras, a measly ten-pound load for the four-hour loop ride. In the evening, paring out the bike gear, I hiked five miles on an out-and-back visit to a natural arch out toward Castle Valley, carrying only six pounds total of water and camera equipment. The day before, Thursday, with my friend Brad Yule from Aspen, I had climbed and skied Mount Sopris, the 12,995-foot monarch of western Colorado, and had carried a few extra clothes and backcountry avalanche rescue gear, but I still kept my load under fifteen pounds.<br> <br>My five-day road trip will culminate on Sunday night with an unsupported solo attempt to mountain bike the 108-mile White Rim Trail in Canyonlands National Park. If I carried the supplies I&#x2019;d used over the three days it took me the first time I rode that trail in 2000, I&#x2019;d have a sixty-pound pack and a sore back before I went ten miles. In my planning estimates this time around, I am hoping to carry fifteen pounds and complete the loop in under twenty-four hours. It will mean following a precision-charted water-management plan to capitalize on the scarce refilling opportunities, no sleeping, and only the bare minimum of stopping. My biggest worry isn&#x2019;t that my legs will get tired&#x2014;I know they will, and I know how to handle it&#x2014;but rather that my, uh, undercarriage will become too sensitive to allow me to ride. &#x201c;Crotch coma,&#x201d; as I&#x2019;ve heard it called, comes from the desensitizing overstimulation of the perineum. As I haven&#x2019;t ridden my bike any extended distance since last summer, my bike-saddle tolerance is disconcertingly low. Had I anticipated this trip prior to two nights ago I would have gone out for at least one long ride in the Aspen area beforehand. As it happened, some friends and I called off a mountaineering trip at the last moment on Wednesday; the cancellation freed me for a hajj to the desert, a pilgrimage for warmth to reacquaint myself with a landscape other than wintry mountains. Usually, I would leave a detailed schedule of my plans with my roommates, but since I left my home in Aspen without knowing what I was going to do, the only word of my destination I gave was &#x201c;Utah.&#x201d; I briefly researched my trip options by consulting my guidebooks as I drove from Mount Sopris to Utah Thursday night. The result has been a capriciously impromptu vacation, one that will even incorporate dropping in on a big campout party near Goblin Valley State Park tonight.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s nearing ten-thirty A.M. as I pedal into the shade of a very lonesome juniper and survey my sunbaked surroundings. The rolling scrub desert gradually drops away into a region of painted rock domes, hidden cliffs, weathered and warped bluffs, tilted and tortured canyons, and broken monoliths. This is hoodoo country; this is voodoo country. This is Abbey&#x2019;s country, the red wasteland beyond the end of the roads. Since I arrived after dark last night, I wasn&#x2019;t able to see much of the landscape on my drive in to the trailhead. As I scan the middle ground to the east for any sign of my destination canyon, I take out my chocolate muffin from the Moab grocery&#x2019;s bakery and have to practically choke it down; both the muffin and my mouth have dried out from exposure to the arid wind. There are copious signs of meandering cattle from a rancher&#x2019;s ongoing attempt to make his living against the odds of the desert. The herds trample sinuous tracks through the indigenous life that spreads out in the ample space: a lace of grasses, foot-tall hedgehog cacti, and black microbiotic crust cloak the red earth. I wash down the rest of the muffin, except for a few crumbs in the wrapper, with several pulls from the CamelBak&#x2019;s hydration tube fastened to my shoulder strap.<br> <br>Remounting, I roll down the road in the wind-protected lee of the ridgeline in front of me, but at the top of the next hill, I&#x2019;m thrust into battle against the gusts once more. After another twenty minutes pistoning my legs along this blast furnace of a road, I see a group of motorbikers passing me on their way to the Maze District of Canyonlands. The dust from the motorbikes blows straight into my face, clogging my nose, my eyes, my tear ducts, even gluing itself to my teeth. I grimace at the grit pasted on my lips, lick my teeth clean, and press on, thinking about where those bikers would be headed.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve visited the Maze only once myself, for about half an hour, nearly ten years ago. When our Cataract Canyon rafting party pulled over in the afternoon to set up camp along the Colorado River at a beach called Spanish Bottom, I hiked a thousand feet up over the rim rock into a place known as the Doll&#x2019;s House. Fifty-to-one-hundred-foot-tall hoodoo rock formations towered above me as I scrambled around the sandstone and granite like a Lilliputian. When I finally turned around to look back at the river, I jerked to a halt and sat on the nearest boulder with a view. It was the first time the features and formative processes of the desert had made me pause and absorb just how small and brave we are, we the human race.<br> <br>Down behind the boats at Spanish Bottom, a furious river churned; suddenly, I perceived in its auburn flow that it was, even at that exact moment, carving that very canyon from a thousand square miles of desert tablelands. From the Doll&#x2019;s House, I had the unexpected impression that I was watching the ongoing birth of an entire landscape, as if I were standing on the rim of an exploding caldera. The vista held for me a feeling of the dawn of time, that primordial epoch before life when there was only desolate land. Like looking through a telescope into the Milky Way and wondering if we&#x2019;re alone in the universe, it made me realize with the glaring clarity of desert light how scarce and delicate life is, how insignificant we are when compared with the forces of nature and the dimensions of space. Were my group to board those two rafts a mile in the distance and depart, I would be as cut off from human contact as a person could be. In fifteen to thirty days&#x2019; time, I would starve in a lonely death as I hiked the meanders back upriver to Moab, never again to see the sign or skin of another human. Yet beyond the paucity and the solitude of the surrounding desert, it was an exultant thought that peeled back the veneer of our self-important delusions. We are not grand because we are at the top of the food chain or because we can alter our environment&#x2014;the environment will outlast us with its unfathomable forces and unyielding powers. But rather than be bound and defeated by our insignificance, we are bold because we exercise our will anyway, despite the ephemeral and delicate presence we have in this desert, on this planet, in this universe. I sat for another ten minutes, then, with my perspective as widened as the view from that bluff, I returned to camp and made extra-short work of dinner.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Riding down the road past the metal culvert that marks the dried-up source of the West Fork of Blue John Canyon, I pass through a signed intersection where a branch of the dirt road splits off toward Hanksville, a small town an hour to the west at the gateway to Capitol Reef National Park. Hanksville is the closest settlement to the Robbers Roost and the Maze District, and home to the nearest landline public telephone in the region. Just a half mile farther, I pass a slanting grassy plain that was an airstrip until whatever minor catastrophe forced whoever was flying there to head back to more tenable ground. It&#x2019;s an indication of how small planes and helicopters are typically the only efficient means of getting from here to there in this country. Some of the time, though, it&#x2019;s not financially worth leaving here to get there, even if you can fly. Better just to stay at home.<br> <br>The Mormons gave their best efforts to transect this part of the country with road grades, but they, too, retreated to the established towns of Green River and Moab. Today most of those Mormon trails have been abandoned and replaced by still barely passable roads whose access by vehicle is, ironically, more sparse than it was by horse or wagon a hundred years ago. Last night I drove fifty-seven miles down the only dirt road in the eastern half of two counties to arrive at my embarkation point&#x2014;it was two and a half hours of washboard driving during which I didn&#x2019;t pass a single light or a house. Frontier ranchers, rustlers, uranium miners, and oil drillers each left a mark on this land but have folded their hands in deference to the stacked deck of desert livelihood.<br> <br>Those seekers of prosperity weren&#x2019;t the first to cross the threshold into this country, only to abandon the region as a barren wasteland: Progressive waves of ancient communities came into being and vanished over the ages in the area&#x2019;s canyon bottoms. Usually, it would be a significant drought or an incursion by hostile bands that made life in the high country and the deserts farther south seem more hospitable. But sometimes there are no defensible answers to explain the sudden evacuation of an entire culture from a particular place. Five thousand years ago, the people of Barrier Creek left their pictographs and petroglyphs at the Great Gallery and Alcove Gallery; then they disappe...</p><h2>Elvis Presley&#39;s Love Me Tender</h2><p><b>The king of rock-and-roll's #1 hit song "Love Me Tender" is now an endearing picture book</b><br><br>Adapted from the unforgettable classic song, <i>Elvis Presley's</i>&nbsp;<i>Love MeTender</i> is a heartwarming ode to the special bond between children and the adults who love and care for them--be they parents, grandparents, adoptive parents, aunts, uncles, or guardians.

Elvis died at his home in Memphis on August 16, 1977. &nbsp;Today, he is regarded as the king of rock-and-roll and one of the most influential pop culture figures of the 20th century.<br><br><b>Stephanie Graegin</b> spent her childhood drawing and collecting fauna in Fort Wayne, Indiana and Houston, Texas. She received her BFA in Fine Arts from the Maryland Institute College of Art and her MFA in Printmaking from the Pratt Institute. Stephanie now lives in Brooklyn, is still drawing, and has managed to keep her collection down to one orange cat.Toddler-PreS&#x2014;Paired with Presley's original lyrics, Graegin's illustrations tell the stories of four families welcoming new babies and celebrating the first few years of life. The pencil-and-watercolor artwork begins with diverse families gathered outside a hospital nursery window peering adoringly at their bundle (or bundles) of joy and the words "Love me tender." All of the families take their babies home to cuddle, love, and celebrate life, right up until they walk their now-preschoolers to Graceland Preschool. Many other nods to Presley and music are worked into the artwork&#x2014;from a mother dancing with her baby, to toy musical instruments, to a record player presumably playing an Elvis album. Even the endpapers show toddlers singing, dancing, and playing instruments. An endnote from Priscilla Presley is included.

But everything is more fun with company, so Mr. Peanuts writes a letter to Cousin Squirrel and invites him for a visit!<br>Featuring candid photographs of wild squirrels in handcrafted, homemade miniature settings, this irresistible book is sure to delight readers young and old!</p><p>Nancy Rose is a photographer living in Canada. Her popular photos of wild squirrels in handcrafted settings, taken in her backyard, have attracted a wide following on Flickr, and have been featured in the <i>Washington Post</i>, the London <i>Times</i>, and <i>Buzzfeed</i>, among many others. She is the author of <i>The Secret Life of Squirrels</i> and <i>Merry Christmas, Squirrels!</i>PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;Rose photographs wild squirrels exploring miniature dollhouse-type sets constructed in her backyard. The story is built around the photos of squirrels interacting with tiny, handmade props. Readers first meet Mr. Peanuts as he pursues his hobbies: cooking on a grill, playing a piano, and engaging with several books in a library set. Feeling lonely, Mr. Peanuts pens a letter, inviting Cousin Squirrel to visit. He prepares for his friend's arrival by cleaning his house, baking a cake, and taking a bath. Once Cousin Squirrel arrives, the two animals sit in a wagon together, enjoy a picnic, and camp out. Rather than being plot- or character-driven, the text seems to exist only to showcase and loosely tie the pictures together. The book ends with "Ten Tips for Photographing Wildlife" and a "Q &amp; A with Nancy Rose." Children may enjoy visually examining Mr. Peanuts' miniature world, but the lackluster text makes this an additional purchase.&#x2014;Laura Hunter, Mount Laurel Library, NJ</p><h2>The Baptist Confession of Faith 1689 (Pocket Puritans)</h2><p>Put forth by the elders and brethren of many congregations of Christians (baptized upon profession of their faith) in London and the country.<br>With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation, Rom.10:10.<br><br>This Confession was first printed in London for Benjamin Harris, to be sold at his shop at the Stationers Arms in Sweetings Rents, in Cornhill, near the Royal Exchange, 1677. <br><br>Only minor alterations to spelling, punctuation and proof texts have been made by the editors of this Pocket Puritan gift edition. <br><br> This little volume is not issued as an authoritative rule, or code of faith, whereby you are to be fettered, but as an assistance to you in controversy, a confirmation in faith, and a means of edification in righteousness.'

This project began in the early 1950&#x2019;s and involved intelligent and patriotic minds of both civilian and military background. These people over the years became known as the White Knights. Out of this restoration process came the Prosperity Programs, the Farmer Claims, and finally NESARA. The children of the wealthy families on our planet became concerned about the future of our civilization, when they observed the poverty, disease, starvation and suffering of the masses. They saw the imbalance between the wealth of the few and the destitution of the many, and agreed among themselves to try to correct it. One hundred of these wealthy children, who came to be known as &#x201c;wealthy visionaries&#x201d;, put one million dollars each, of their money, into investment programs in the 1980&#x2019;s called &#x201c;roll programs&#x201d; to generate funds to be used for humanitarian purposes. Thus, the Prosperity Programs were born. Gradually, news of this spread to the public and millions of people invested small amounts of their meager funds to aid in these various Prosperity Programs success. Also, during the 1970&#x2019;s and 1980&#x2019;s many U.S. farmers were losing their land, machinery, buildings, and cattle due to fraudulent foreclosures by the Federal Reserve Banks, in cooperation with the IRS. Many farmers joined forces and brought a class action lawsuit against the U.S. Government, the non-federal Federal Reserve Bank, and the IRS, for fraud against the farmers.</p><p></p><h2>Lyric Preludes in Romantic Style: 24 Short Piano Pieces in All Keys</h2><p>Lyric Preludes is an introduction to the whole Romantic period -- from Chopin and Schumann to Brahms and Debussy.

This is the story of becoming, the process of actualization that we all go through, especially when we are most unaware that it&#x2019;s happening. Written with striking familiarity and uncanny understanding, this book will open your heart and touch your soul by putting into words the things that are both deeply rooted and hidden in us that we miss them even when they are most transparent. The human element is the thing that binds us, the thing we have to overcome, how we have to stop standing in our own way and let everything unfold. It is a philosophical take on what it means to overcome humanness by acceptance, initially realized through the experiences of sleep paralysis and other awakenings.</p><p>No Bio</p><h2>A Tune a Day - Violin: Book 1</h2><p>(Music Sales America).

Collards never did make for good eating, but I was wondering if maybe they were some kind of sign that it was time for me to skedaddle. Collards always reminded me of Mama. She used to make me drawing paper out of collards, sumac seeds, dryer lint, and newspaper Daddy chopped up in his wood chipper. She plunked things in her paper the way other people stuck things in scrapbooks. Thread from the hem of her wedding dress, a four-leaf clover, Daddy&#x2019;s first gray hair. Mama&#x2019;s paper held so much life, it made my drawings pop right off the page.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was the kind of mama and daddy I used to have.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was ruffling up those collards, mourning my daddy and scheming on how to sneak away to win back Mama. Not that I had much time for scheming. Aunt Belinda, Little Quinn, Jackson, and Clay were the next aisle over. My cousins were working hard at plowing down every last tower of cans in that store. Aunt Belinda, she was working hard at keeping some distance between her cart and those crashes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Me, I was supposed to be finding Aunt Belinda some hot sauce. She hadn&#x2019;t even started her potato salad or her red velvet cake, and already folks were busy unsnapping folding chairs, setting up for the fry. As in the February Firehouse Jubilee Fish Fry and Red Velvet Cake Cook-Off--the place where Aunt Belinda said she was finally going to land herself a new husband to take the place of Daddy&#x2019;s no-account brother. She already had her sights set on the new fireman, the one with the king-cab truck.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Get your head out of the clouds, Cricket.&#x201d; Aunt Belinda knocked my hand off the collards. So much for signs. &#x201c;Make yourself useful. I need that hot sauce. And call Aunt Fig and find out whether her cake recipe calls for buttermilk or sweet milk.&#x201d; She handed me her cell phone.<br> &nbsp;<br> It came alive with the sound of &#x201c;Love Me Like You Mean It.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Aunt Belinda grabbed back the phone. &#x201c;WOKT Country is my favorite radio station,&#x201d; she chirped.<br> &nbsp;<br> I rolled my eyes. Soon as Aunt Belinda got named a finalist for the Dollywood Trivia Trip of a Lifetime, she&#x2019;d started answering her phone that way so she&#x2019;d win if WOKT called.<br> &nbsp;<br> Aunt Belinda ducked her chin and shuffled two steps back. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t talk now. This coming Wednesday. Got it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She rambled through her purse, found the Post-it note with her to-do list, and scratched down two lines. Slapping the note on top of her purse, she looked at my bangs, not meeting my eyes. &#x201c;Pecans are your favorite, right?&#x201d; She threw a big bag in her cart, the expensive kind, not store brand.<br> &nbsp;<br> My neck hairs went prickly.<br> &nbsp;<br> With money too tight even for dollar-store art supplies, why was Aunt Belinda buying me things all of a sudden? Did she want me to do some more blind-date babysitting? I poked at the bag. &#x201c;Who was that on the phone?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Aunt Belinda just stared at the rutabagas, sucking her cheeks in like she was working on a mint. Finally, she yanked a tube of Wanda&#x2019;s Classy Lady Peach Passion lipstick out of her purse and jerked it across her lips. &#x201c;Never you mind. Now get me that hot sauce. Pronto.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My cousins swarmed up and started prying the bottom okra can out of the pyramid display.<br> &nbsp;<br> Aunt Belinda spun her cart around, and the sticky note flew off her purse.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey, you dropped . . . ,&#x201d; I yelled after her, but she was already speeding toward the meat section.<br> &nbsp;<br> I left the note right where it was. The sooner I found the hot sauce, the sooner we could all get out of the store.<br> &nbsp;<br> But before I even got past the Duke&#x2019;s mayonnaise, I spotted her--a little brown cricket stuck in a spiderweb on the baseboard.<br> &nbsp;<br> The poor thing was trapped even worse than me. She was trying to wiggle out and was tangling herself up worse. The spider skittered close.<br> &nbsp;<br> I snatched that cricket loose.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not fast enough.<br> &nbsp;<br> I saved her from the spider, but Little Quinn swooped in like a duck on a June bug. &#x201c;Look, Clay, Cricket&#x2019;s done found herself a cricket. Maybe they&#x2019;re related.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Twisting away, I studied the bug in my hand. It was probably her and her kin who&#x2019;d been making music in our backyard all last summer.<br> &nbsp;<br> After a minute, she figured out I wasn&#x2019;t going to hurt her none. Her antennae relaxed, and she took a tiny step on legs as thin as embroidery thread. She looked like she was listening for something. Was she hoping for the sound of someone out there calling, calling, calling, and waiting for her to answer back?<br> &nbsp;<br> Maybe I did have more in common with that bug than just a name.<br> &nbsp;<br> The cricket turned her warm brown eyes on me and cocked her head. I swear she saw inside me and asked the same exact question I&#x2019;d been asking myself for days: Just how far will you go to get your mama back?<br> &nbsp;<br> Before I could even think about answering, Little Quinn pulled a firecracker out of his pocket and dug for the matches. &#x201c;Hand her over.&#x201d; He sounded bored. It was just another blowing-things-up Saturday.<br> &nbsp;<br> I kicked him in the shin, not hard enough to leave a bruise he could point at, just enough to get him out of the way. Pulling the cricket in tight, I shot for the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Aunt Belinda wheeled up and pointed at me with a Trans Am&#x2013;red fingernail. &#x201c;Put that nasty thing down and find me that hot sauce.&#x201d; She plopped a loaf of white bread in her cart and cut her eyes toward the store clock, its hands almost at noon. &#x201c;You know they&#x2019;re shutting up early for the fry.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Just a minute. I need to . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Aunt Belinda tilted her face toward the greasy ceiling tiles. &#x201c;Lord, please save me from selfish children.&#x201d; Then her voice turned into the one she used when she was trying to get her boys to bed. &#x201c;Just help me out this one time, Cricket. For the fry. Will you do that much?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; I sighed, trying to get out of hearing, for the umpteenth time, all the things Aunt Belinda used to do to help out her family when she was twelve.<br> &nbsp;<br> My cousins swaggered closer, blocking the way to the door. I had to get the cricket out if she was going to make it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Gotta go.&#x201d; I swerved toward the bathroom.<br> &nbsp;<br> The back lights were already off, and I fumbled for the bathroom switch. One tiny window glowed on the rear wall, the glass painted in the same overcooked butter-bean color as the rest of the store. A slice of light showed through the bottom, though, where the window was pushed out. Just big enough for the cricket.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was the good news. The bad news was, the window was too high to reach. A tall trash can stood next to the door. I waltzed it side to side over to the window, holding my breath against the smell of dirty diapers, Comet, and wet brown paper towels.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Cricket, I hope you&#x2019;re grateful,&#x201d; I whispered.<br> &nbsp;<br> She wasn&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp;<br> Soon as I opened my fingers to check on her, she sprang onto the lightbulb over the mirror.<br> &nbsp;<br> I wriggled my way onto a sink, prayed the whole thing wouldn&#x2019;t fall off the wall, and tried to coax her loose before she got burned.<br> &nbsp;<br> Instead, she catapulted onto the top of a stall. Balancing on a lopsided toilet seat, I lunged after her. Aunt Belinda was going to kill me for taking so long.<br> &nbsp;<br> By the time I finally caught her, we&#x2019;d visited all four toilets once and some two times.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was out of breath and really, really needed to wash my hands.<br> &nbsp;<br> But I&#x2019;ll say one thing for that cricket&#x2014;she had a mind of her own. &#x201c;Names carry a power,&#x201d; Daddy always said. Right then and there, I picked out a good one for her--Charlene. Mama&#x2019;s middle name.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hoisting myself onto the trash can rim, I pushed the window open wider and started to let Charlene out. But instead of clean air, I got slapped with the smell of fresh-poured asphalt from the side parking lot. Charlene would get stuck in the tar. I&#x2019;d have to take her out the front. I eased the bathroom door open.<br> &nbsp;<br> The store was dark, too dark.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was too quiet.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was too empty.<br> &nbsp;<br> It took me about a minute to figure out that the only living creatures in the store were me and that cricket.<br> &nbsp;<br> She stared at me with those question eyes of hers, waiting on me to make the next move.<br><br></p></p><h2>Ballpark Mysteries #8: The Missing Marlin</h2><p>It's the eighth inning! <i>The Missing Marlin</i> is book #8 in our early chapter book mystery series, where each book is set in a different American ballpark!<br><br>Mike and Kate are in Miami visiting Kate's Uncle Oliver&#x2014;and the Miami Marlins ballpark, of course!

This biography demonstrates that Powell's decades-long development as an exemplary subordinate is crucial to understanding his astonishing rise from a working-class immigrant neighborhood to the highest echelons of military and political power.<br><br>Once an aimless, ambitionless teenager who barely graduated from college, Powell became an extraordinarily effective and staunchly loyal subordinate to many powerful superiors who, in turn, helped to advance his career. By the time Powell became chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he had developed into the consummate follower&#x2015;motivated, competent, composed, honorable, and independent.&nbsp;<br><br>The quality of Powell's followership faltered at times, however, while in Vietnam, during the Iran-Contra scandal, and after he became George W. Bush's secretary of state. Powell proved a fallible patriot, and in the course of a long and distinguished career he made some grave and consequential errors in judgment. While those blunders do not erase the significance of his commendable achievements amid decades of public service, they are failures nonetheless.<br><br><i>Imperfect Patriot</i> is the fascinating story of Powell's professional life, and of what we can learn from both his good <i>and</i> bad followership. The book is written for a broad readership, and will be of special interest to readers of military history, political biography, and leadership.</p><p>Jeffrey J. Matthews is the George Frederick Jewett Distinguished Professor at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington. He teaches American history and leadership, and has written or edited three previous books, including <i>Blacksheep Leadership</i> and <i>The Art of Command: Military Leadership from George Washington to Colin Powell</i>."The consummate general, national security advisor, Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff, Secretary of State and Patriot is profiled and on full display in Matthews' work. Well-researched and full of rich detail, the book seems to be a balanced, albeit critical, review of the Powell's 40+ years of service. From the My Lai Massacre in Vietnam, to the Iran Contra Affair, to the decision making leading to the ill-fated choice to go to war with Iraq in 2003 in what turned out to be empty justification owing to a lack of finding WMD, Matthews (and many others) believed Powell should have acted more ethically. Many also believe, Matthews among them, that Powell's loyalty--his own self-described best trait--was a fault in certain circumstances of providing advice when he should have been better guided by his sense of doing the right thing. Matthews makes note of Powell's followership as an 'assistant' and 'deputy' in many of his duties throughout his career, contributing to why he was a great leader. Yet ultimately, even the best leaders make mistakes and are fallible, and we can all learn from that."--Brigadier General Chad Manske, Commandant, National War College.<br><br>"Jeffrey Matthews's excellent biography rightly praises Colin Powell's distinguished service over the past half-century, while also delineating how Powell faltered at crucial moments while serving as George W. Bush's secretary of state. This is a comprehensive and compelling analysis." --Walter LaFeber, the Andrew and James Tisch University Professor Emeritus, Cornell University<br><br>"At its base is a very well-written story about Colin Powell as <i>fallible everyman</i>. It is an almost <i>existential </i>portrait of the human condition. We all make choices every day; some are good, but some are grave errors in judgment that can have disastrous consequences for a family or for a nation. In my opinion, this book is the most important of the publications focusing on this turbulent period of American political and military history."--Howard Ball, author of <i>Bush,</i> <i>the Detainees, and the Constitution</i><br><br>"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Jeff Matthews's book. It is extremely thorough, nicely grounded in appropriate research, and is very well written. I can't think of a biographical work that focuses on aspects of leadership and followership in such consistent and illuminating detail. It's a page-turner."--George R. Goethals, E. Claiborne Robins Distinguished Professor, Jepson School of Leadership Studies, University of Richmond&nbsp;<br><br>"A compelling, clear-eyed portrait of one of the more magnetic figures in modern American politics--Colin Powell. Powell's story is remarkable and Jeffrey Matthews handles it with skill and balance.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is no hagiography. Consisting of equal parts admiration and critical scrutiny, it is a tough and insightful portrayal of a commanding personality who was capable of both towering professional achievements and astonishing failures of judgment and ethics. Beyond pure biography, Matthews has produced a fascinating case study of the human elements of public service and leadership." --Malcolm Byrne, deputy director, National Security Archive</p><h2>Beyond Basketball: Coach K&#39;s Keywords for Success</h2><p>The Duke University men's basketball team has served as the gold standard in college athletics for well over two decades - and that's all because of the extraordinary impact of Mike Krzyzewski, the highly-respected coach of the Duke squad.<br><br>Coach K's reputation as a teacher of young men has transcended his extraordinary success as a coach. The Duke team is always ranked at the top of the college game, year in and year out, but what's truly remarkable about Coach K are his players and the legacy they leave behind: Grant Hill, Shane Battier, Elton Brand, Bobby Hurley, and on and on -- these are not just great basketball players, but individuals who have become true leaders in American society, all thanks in large part to Coach K's leadership.<br><br>So how does Coach K do it? In this new book, he reveals his tips, advice, and time-tested guidance on how he coaches and educates his players about life beyond the basketball court.<br></p><p>In addition to winning numerous NCAA championships and Coach of the Year awards, Coach K has also been selected to coach the USA men&#39;s basketball team at the Summer Olympics in 2008.By one of the best college coaches of all time, these lessons are valuable additions to Coach K's other teachings on basketball and life. He's so wise and articulate in these matters that few listeners will pay much attention to his speaking style, which tends to be flat, whether he's reading or speaking extemporaneously. The essays are organized around 40 words or phrases such as commitment, dependability, selflessness, and trust. Though they may sound like overused principles, in Coach K's hands they take on a vibrancy and credibility that is seldom matched in other audios on success. With priceless examples from the worlds of college and professional sports, this is an essential lesson for anyone who influences young people.

In his senior year, he led Ambridge High School to an undefeated state championship, and his still is still considered the best to ever play in Pennsylvania. His name is in the Basketball Hall of Fame, on Parade Magazine&#x2019;s 1967 All-American First Five. Two years later, at Duke University, Dick was an All-ACC selection, and in 1971, a First Team Academic All-American. After graduating from Duke, Dick played and coached professional basketball in Europe and South America and founded the now nationally acclaimed Point Guard College. Considered by many to be a basketball genius and gifted writer, Dick&#x2019;s writings and basketball programs have inspired and influenced countless coaches and athletes. He died in 2001 at age 52.</p><h2>WeirDo (WeirDo #1) (1)</h2><p><b>From bestselling author Anh Do comes the hilarious hit chapter book series, WeirDo. These illustrated books will keep readers laughing as Weir and his friends navigate the trials of elementary school.</b><br><br>Meet Weir Do.<br><br>No, that's not a typo, that's his name!<br><br>Weir Do's the new kid in school. With an unforgettable name, a crazy family, and some seriously weird habits, fitting in won't be easy . . . but it will be funny!</p><p>Anh Do is an accomplished writer, actor, producer and stand-up comedian, as well as a runner up on Australia&#39;s Dancing with the Stars. His award-winning adult autobiography, The Happiest Refugee, is an international bestseller, and he&#39;s the author of two bestselling chapter book series, WeirDo and Ninja Kid. He lives in Sydney, Australia.Gr 1&#x2013;4&#x2014;Weir Do thinks he lost the lottery when it comes to names. His mother named him after her last name before marriage, and Do (rhymes with "go") may pay homage to his father's Vietnamese heritage, but does Weir no favors when he starts a new school. However, Weir's name is only the beginning of his problems as he struggles to make new friends and impress his crush despite her meeting his family, who live up to his "weird" namesake. The line cartoons that accompany the spare text makes this title serviceable to younger or reluctant readers. However, despite the diversity of the cast and often bodily-function induced chuckles provided by the author, other troubling aspects lie beneath the seemingly harmless doodles. Noting "a few surefire signs" on how to spot slow guys before a race, such as "socks pulled up too high" as well as a muscle contest between the boys after a female classmate compliments Weir's as "huge" knocks on toxic masculinity's door. Lining up girls in Weir's class in order of attractiveness, with his crush being seventh, as well as Weir's older sister shaming him for wearing her hand-me-down shoes round out the casual misogyny. As the book is already so short with not much plot outside of fart jokes and crushes, any misstep may as well be a full-on crash landing. VERDICT A passable purchase for those in desperate need of Wimpy Kid readalikes, but most socially conscious collections would be better served with Janet Tashjian's My Life as a Book or Stephan Pastis's "Timmy Failure" books.&#x2014;Brittany Drehobl, Morton Grove Public Library, IL</p><h2>Jumping Into Kindergarten</h2><p><p>Kindergarten represents a big jump into the unknown that, while exciting, can also cause nervous anticipation for everyone involved.

She lives peacefully among friends and neighbors and family in the idyllic town of Valparaiso, Chile&#x2014;until one day when warships are spotted in the harbor and schoolmates start disappearing from class without a word. Celeste doesn&#x2019;t quite know what is happening, but one thing is clear: no one is safe, not anymore.<br> <br>The country has been taken over by a government that declares artists, protestors, and anyone who helps the needy to be considered &#x201c;subversive&#x201d; and dangerous to Chile&#x2019;s future. So Celeste&#x2019;s parents&#x2014;her educated, generous, kind parents&#x2014;must go into hiding before they, too, &#x201c;disappear.&#x201d; Before they do, however, they send Celeste to America to protect her.<br> <br>As Celeste adapts to her new life in Maine, she never stops dreaming of Chile. But even after democracy is restored to her home country, questions remain: Will her parents reemerge from hiding? Will she ever be truly safe again?<br> <br>Accented with interior artwork, steeped in the history of Pinochet&#x2019;s catastrophic takeover of Chile, and based on many true events, this multicultural ode to the power of revolution, words, and love is both indelibly brave and heartwrenchingly graceful.</p><p>Marjorie Agos�n is the Pura Belpr� Award-winning author of <i>I Lived on Butterfly Hill</i>.

I&#x2019;d been watching the sky from the classroom windows all day, wondering just when the rain would pour down. I run down the hall and through the front doors with Lucila, Marisol, and Gloria at my heels. &#x201c;Quick, girls, get under my umbrella!&#x201d; Marisol shouts, and her cousin Lucila and I huddle close, one on each side of her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Valpara�so will be a swamp for the third weekend in a row.&#x201d; Gloria groans as she opens her own umbrella. Crist�bal Williams catches up to us, grinning hello, but his smile quickly turns into a yawn. &#x201c;Here, Se�or Sleepyhead. I&#x2019;ll share if you hold it.&#x201d; Gloria shoves her pink umbrella into Crist�bal&#x2019;s hand&#x2014;the one not holding the magic pendulum he almost always carries with him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m starving,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go eat something.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s Crist�bal. Always sleepy and always hungry.<br> <br>&#x201c;Caf� Iris? Sopaipillas?&#x201d; I suggest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where else?&#x201d; exclaims Lucila, who loves Caf� Iris just as much as I do. The others nod their agreement and start walking up the narrow sidewalk crowded with people rushing to escape the rain, all trying not to fall into the gutter. A crowd of people swarms the cable car stop at the bottom of Bar�n Hill. From the weary expressions on their faces, I can tell this cable car is probably running slow&#x2014;or not at all. On days when the rain is heavy, the mud flowing down the hills leaves all sorts of obstacles&#x2014;tires, trash barrels, tricycles, and many lost umbrellas&#x2014;on the wooden tracks.<br> <br>We look at one another and roll our eyes. &#x201c;Not again,&#x201d; Gloria groans. Crist�bal yawns and throws his hands up like a question mark. We are all used to waiting for, and wondering about, the cable cars. Valpara�so is a city of hills&#x2014;forty-two of them&#x2014;that rise in the shape of a crescent moon overlooking the harbor. The cable cars are painted in beautiful crimsons, sapphires, greens, and golds that from a distance conceal their age&#x2014;some were built a hundred years ago. And they still manage&#x2014;on most days, that is&#x2014;to carry people to and from their homes on the steep hills. No matter how many times I have ridden the Bar�n Hill cable car, it&#x2019;s always exciting. The track is so steep and the car so shaky that sometimes I fear it will topple down into the harbor far, far below. So that&#x2019;s when I look out the other window, up toward the hills. They look like they&#x2019;re on a canvas where a painter has made one brushstroke with each of the colors on his palette, side by side in rows and columns atop one another. Such are the houses on the hills of my city, all knit tightly together like a quilt my Nana Delfina hangs out on the clothesline to dry, blowing in the wind&#x2014;up, up, up&#x2014;into the sky.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait. I hear one coming,&#x201d; Marisol says. We all look up toward the low humming noise that reminds me of Abuela Frida&#x2019;s voice when she has a scratchy throat.<br> <br>&#x201c;There, I see one coming,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;But the line is so long,&#x201d; Lucila reminds us. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be waiting here for at least two more to come before it&#x2019;s our turn.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s walk!&#x201d; Gloria calls to us over the din. Marisol, who can be a bit lazy sometimes, groans under her breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on. It&#x2019;s good for you,&#x201d; urges Lucila.<br> <br>&#x201c;Easy for you to say, Lucila Long Legs,&#x201d; Marisol retorts.<br> <br>By the time we reach Caf� Iris at the top of Cerro Bar�n, one of the highest and most famous of Valpara�so&#x2019;s hills&#x2014;the one sailors look for to spot our city from their boats at sea&#x2014;we are breathless, soaked, and shivering. It always feels like I can see the entire Pacific Ocean stretch out beneath me from this spot. I look out today on the harbor, covered with a gray mist. Then I blink my eyes a few times. I&#x2019;ve been looking down at the harbor all my life, but today something seems different. Wrong, almost.<br> <br>&#x201c;Does the harbor look strange to you?&#x201d; I ask my friends. They look at me as if to say, Not another one of your stories. We&#x2019;re too big to play pretend anymore. &#x201c;No, really, look!&#x201d; I protest. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t my imagination. Just look and tell me what you see.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Water?&#x201d; suggests Lucila. &#x201c;Fog, boats&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Boats! That&#x2019;s it!&#x201d; I exclaim.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s it?&#x201d; Gloria asks.<br> <br>&#x201c;The boats,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re bigger than usual, really more like ships than boats. And there are a lot of them. I just think it&#x2019;s strange, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not the only thing that&#x2019;s strange,&#x201d; Marisol teases me, and turns me in the direction of Caf� Iris.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be mean, Marisol!&#x201d; Lucila scolds her.<br> <br>We go inside and shake off the rain. Crist�bal finds us a toasty booth in the corner, and we order a plate of steaming sopaipillas to share. With my mouth full of delicious fried pumpkin bread, I mumble, &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;re lucky the winds are always bringing in rain this time of year.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not me,&#x201d; proclaims Marisol.<br> <br>&#x201c;Me neither,&#x201d; says Gloria.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;s that, Celeste?&#x201d; Lucila asks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sopaipillas!&#x201d; I say, my mouth full now with my second bite. &#x201c;Just when I almost forget their taste, another storm blows in and I get to try them all over again.&#x201d; In Chile it is a tradition to eat sopaipillas&#x2014;round and warm like smiles&#x2014;only on rainy days.<br> <br>Gloria rolls her eyes, and the other girls giggle. But Crist�bal says, &#x201c;Me too. I agree with Celeste.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ahh! A wise choice, young man, to agree with the lovely Se�orita Marconi. For I have known Celeste since she was just a little bean&#x2014;more wee, if you can imagine, than she is now&#x2014;and she is a wise old girl, wise beyond her years.&#x201d; I laugh at the Caf� Iris magician. He&#x2019;s always teasing me but also always encouraging me to trust what he calls my intuition. El mago winks, reaches for my hand, and gives it a kiss. Like always, he wears a green silk shirt and bright orange suspenders, his frame as tall and narrow as if someone had pasted patent leather shoes to the bottom of the map of Chile.<br> <br>Crist�bal loves visiting el mago, probably because Crist�bal does a kind of magic too. He uses his pendulum to draw maps in the sand&#x2014;to find lost items and predict the future. Last week the pendulum showed him just where the sun would come out and paint a rainbow over Butterfly Hill.<br> <br>Crist�bal&#x2019;s mother made his pendulum when he was four years old, after his father died. The only thing that made him smile was to visit el mago and watch him read the crystal ball and pull doves from his cape. One day el mago told Crist�bal&#x2019;s mother to give her son a pendulum&#x2014;that it would become an inner compass that would stay with him all his life, a firm hand to guide him the way his father might have. His mother, not having much money, made the pendulum herself. She polished a piece of crystal-blue sea glass until it was smooth and round like an egg. Then she hung it from the silver chain that had once carried her husband&#x2019;s pocket watch. And because el mago told her the pendulum must end in a point, Crist�bal&#x2019;s mother melted a hairpin and fastened it to the bottom of the sea glass. Ever since, whenever we&#x2019;ve had a question, serious or silly, we&#x2019;ve begged Crist�bal to ask his pendulum for the answer.<br> <br>Today, over our second steaming plate of sopaipillas, Marisol asks with a wicked smile, &#x201c;So, just who at this table is in love with Juan Carlos, the new boy in eighth grade?&#x201d;<br> <br>We all know the answer, but wait with bated breath for the pendulum to prove us right.<br> <br>Crist�bal dangles the pendulum in the air so that its hairpin point just grazes the flat surface of the table. Then he closes his eyes. Quick as a flash the pendulum moves in Gloria&#x2019;s direction. We burst out laughing. Everyone, that is, but Gloria.<br> <br>&#x201c;I knew it! I could have told you that a week ago!&#x201d; Marisol gloats triumphantly.<br> <br>Gloria tosses her blond curls and rolls her eyes. &#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m not in love with him! I just think he&#x2019;s handsome, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d; But the pendulum, with a life of its own, stretches the chain farther across the table, straining to reach Gloria. Lucila, Marisol, and I squeal and giggle some more!<br> <br>Crist�bal, seeing how flustered Gloria has become, pulls the pendulum from the table and tucks it into his pocket. But Marisol isn&#x2019;t done teasing. &#x201c;We can always get a second opinion and ask el mago about your love life, Gloria. What do you think he&#x2019;ll say?&#x201d;<br> <br>Gloria blushes as pink as her umbrella. &#x201c;No! Never mind! Don&#x2019;t call el mago over here.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Fine, I admit it, I like him. I said like, not love. Are you satisfied?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;�S�!&#x201d; the rest of us shout in unison.<br> <br>We all laugh, Gloria included, until we clutch our full bellies. Then I start to hiccup, and the laughter starts again, until all our cheeks turn as rosy and warm as Gloria&#x2019;s.<br> <br>When we leave Caf� Iris, we step into torrents of muddy water pouring down the steep street. The wind blows hard from the west, over the harbor and up the hills, making the raindrops fly sideways, stinging my cheeks. When it rains in Valpara�so, not only the skies open. My eyes, the sea, the streets, even the ships&#x2014;everything fills with water and overflows. Ships. Suddenly remembering them, I shield my eyes and peer toward the harbor. But it&#x2019;s hard to see anything except blankets of gray.<br> <br>Winds from the south, then the north, meet and swirl around us like a windmill&#x2014;blowing newspapers and flowerpots and lost umbrellas all over the place&#x2014;making it hard to see one another. &#x201c;Celeste, stay close to us!&#x201d; I hear Crist�bal shout.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; Something strikes me in the head. I look down to see a doll&#x2014;a body without a head&#x2014;rolling at my feet. I shiver, the hair on my arms standing straight up.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lucila! Where are you? Grab my hand!&#x201d; I hear Marisol call to her cousin. I look in the direction of her voice, mesmerized by what I see. Swiftly, silently, slyly the fog swallows Lucila&#x2019;s head, then her hands, her feet, most of her torso. The only thing I can make out is the place where her heart is. My own heart starts beating fast.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lucila!&#x201d; I cry out, panicked. &#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Celeste, I&#x2019;m here. I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>I let out my breath when I hear her voice. Then Marisol&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. I got her.&#x201d; I breathe even easier when the fog begins to lift like a veil from their faces. Why did that scare me so much? I&#x2019;m used to the tricks the weather plays. Why am I so nervous today?<br> <br>&#x201c;Celeste, earth to Celeste.&#x201d; Gloria tugs at my sleeve. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s late. You better get moving or your nana is going to be cross and waiting for you at the door.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Gracias, Gloria. I&#x2019;ll hurry.&#x201d; I give my friends each a kiss on the cheek. &#x201c;Bye, everyone! See you Monday!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;�Adi�s, Celeste!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;�Adi�s!&#x201d;<br> <br>As I climb the winding paths up Butterfly Hill to where my house sits&#x2014;rather slanted&#x2014;at the very top, I pause every so often to look around. I look at my feet, remembering the doll, and then out toward the harbor, remembering the ships. And I shudder when I recall how eerie it was to see Lucila disappear bit by bit.<br> <br>I feel better when I pass our neighbor Se�ora Atkinson&#x2019;s tall pink house. On days like this she always stands in the window with a china teacup in one hand, tilting her head like a swan. She says the rains remind her of her youth in London, and there is never a more perfect time than a wet Valpara�so afternoon to drink tea and look out the window.<br> <br>I wave to her, and she opens the window. &#x201c;Cheers, Celeste!&#x201d; She calls to me in English that sounds like the trilling of the yellow canary she keeps in her parlor.<br> <br>I wonder if she&#x2019;s noticed anything different about the ships today.<br> <br>Delfina has been waiting, as Gloria predicted. She opens the door and wraps a warm towel around my shoulders. &#x201c;At night everyone returns to their proper place, including mischievous girls who always lose track of the time.&#x201d; She puts on her sternest face. &#x201c;Now go upstairs and change, and then come down to the kitchen. I want you to help me chop herbs for dinner.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;S�, Delfina.&#x201d; I climb the drafty, winding stairs to my blue bedroom that&#x2019;s so high, at night I imagine I am sleeping on a cloud in the sky. Which makes sense to me, since that is what my name, Celeste, means&#x2014;like the sky. Like any sky, I suppose, sometimes I am bright and clear, and other times I can be quite a raincloud. I like to think more often than not that I&#x2019;m a sunny day, with just a few easy clouds that blow in and out with the breeze.</p><h2>100 Women Who Made History: Remarkable Women Who Shaped Our World (DK 100 Things That Made History)</h2><p><p>Celebrate centuries of brave and brilliant women with this visual guide that takes kids on a tour of the past and uncovers the stories of the women and girls who have shaped the modern world.</p><p>From super scientists like Marie Curie and Rosalind Franklin to clued-up creatives like Emily Dickinson and J.K.

And it is well understood that creating a new business and optimizing an already existing one are two fundamentally different management challenges. The real problem for leaders is doing both, simultaneously. How do you meet the performance requirements of the existing business one that is still thriving while dramatically reinventing it? How do you envision a change in your current business model before a crisis forces you to abandon it?<br><br>Innovation guru Vijay Govindarajan expands the leader&#x2019;s innovation tool kit with a simple and proven method for allocating the organization&#x2019;s energy, time, and resources in balanced measure across what he calls the three boxes&#x201d;:<br><br> Box 1: The present Manage the core business at peak profitability<br> Box 2: The past Abandon ideas, practices, and attitudes that could inhibit innovation<br> Box 3: The future Convert breakthrough ideas into new products and businesses<br><br>The three-box framework makes leading innovation easier because it gives leaders a simple vocabulary and set of tools for managing and measuring these different sets of behaviors and activities across all levels of the organization. Supported with rich company examples GE, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, Hasbro, IBM, United Rentals, and Tata Consultancy Services and testimonies of leaders who have successfully used this framework, this book solves once and for all the practical dilemma of how to align an organization on the critical but competing demands of innovation.<br></p><p><b>Vijay Govindarajan</b> (known as VG) is the Coxe Distinguished Professor at Dartmouth&#x2019;s Tuck School of Business, a Marvin Bower Fellow at Harvard Business School, and widely regarded as one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts on strategy and innovation.

This definitive edition includes all 85 articles, and the text of the Constitution for ease of reference.</b><br><br>Introduced and passed into law between 1787 and 1788, these papers were influential in persuading the citizens of the states to ratify the United States Constitution. Most of the Federalist Papers are occupied directly or indirectly with the terms of the constitution, explaining and justifying how each was laid out. There is some diversion between the opinions expressed and events which followed - Hamilton, for example, was opposed to the notion of a Bill of Rights as he felt the original document provided enough protection for the citizenry. However, the Bill of Rights was eventually created in 1789 and ratified in 1791. <br><br>The Federalist Papers were written in part to clarify the scope and purposes of the United States Constitution, and partly to rebuke critics within New York state who felt such a document would be either inevitably flawed or even unnecessary. James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay were determined to answer each and every critic's points with well-reasoned arguments, dealing with each objection in detail. <br><br>The political climate at the time, wherein the United States had not existed for long, and the Constitution was not ratified in several states including New York, meant the authors remained anonymous. However, certain figures could discern their individual writing styles and would later confirm the authors of all eighty-five papers. However, the authors were not accredited until 1804 when a list of each article and its author was published. <br><br>Important as an early and authoritative insight into constitutional law, certain papers form early examples of the principles of United States government. Many remain consulted by legal scholars and practicing lawyers within and outside the USA, and are cited in legal arguments within courts of law. The detailed discussion of the Constitution and its terms by some of its own signatories are the most authentic expositions ever written, although the extent of influence the Federalist Papers had on the ratification process has been disputed by historians and scholars.</p><p></p><h2>Arroz con leche: canciones y ritmos populares de Am�rica Latina Popular Songs and Rhymes From Latin America (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p>A collection of traditional Latin-American songs and rhymes, in Spanish and English, with the music included.</p><p>Lulu Delacre was born to Argentinian parents and grew up in Puerto Rico.

This trip to the nation&#x2019;s capital will be full of shifting alliances and betrayals, carsickness and sugar rushes. Trouble starts even before the buses leave school, when Principal Rabbski decrees the field trip an &#x201c;origami-free zone.&#x201d; Dwight secretly folds a Yoda from a Fruit Roll-Up, but will Fruitigami Yoda be a match for Harvey&#x2019;s sour, hate-filled pickle of darkness?<br></p><p><b>Tom Angleberger</b> is the bestselling author of the beloved Origami Yoda series. He is also the author of <i>Horton Halfpott</i>, <i>Fake Mustache</i>, the Inspector Flytrap series, and the Qwikpick Papers series. He is married to author/illustrator Cece Bell and lives in Christiansburg, Virginia.Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;The fateful day has finally arrived for the seventh graders at McQuarrie Middle School to embark on their much-anticipated field trip to Washington, DC, their reward for defeating the FunTime Menace back in Princess Labelmaker to the Rescue (Abrams/Amulet, 2014). When cell phones and origami (and paper altogether) are banned on the trip by Principal Rabbski, and "bus buddies" are mandated, the kids are anxious that things might turn "nostrul" (awful). Tommy and the gang open a new case file chronicling their ups and downs, with Kellen adding the riotous illustrations. Smuggled cell phones and lime Fruit Roll-Ups used to create Fruitigami Yoda may save the day, but Harvey threatens to sour everyone's plans with his smuggled evil origami, Emperor Pickletine (with real pickle head). Chaperones include Mr. Good Clean Fun (along with his monkey puppet, Soapy) and dreaded Mr. Howell, who seems destined to thwart any possible fun. Can the students avoid the standardized tests? Will Fruitigami Yoda conquer Emperor Pickletine? As Angleberger brings the wildly popular series to a close (or does he?), age-appropriate boy-girl relationships are explored, and most of the story lines are wrapped up. As in the previous titles, instructions to make the origami figures are included, and this installment also includes an entertaining chart showing the effects of Origami Yoda on all of the pertinent characters.

(Leslie Patricelli board books)</h2><p><b>The inimitable Baby brings a humorous spin to the holidays in a cheerful board book fit for trick-or-treat bags.</b><br><br>It&#x2019;s almost Halloween! How should Daddy carve the pumpkin? So many expressions to choose from! What should Baby be&#x2014;a princess or pirate, ballerina or clown? When the jack-o&#x2019;-lantern&#x2019;s ready (looking suspiciously like Baby), it&#x2019;s time for a little ghost to head out in the slightly scary night. But fear turns to excitement as the pumpkin fills up with treats. WOW!</p><p><b>Leslie Patricelli</b> is the creator of a series of best-selling board books starring her beloved bald baby as well as <i>Higher! Higher!, Faster! Faster!,</i> <i>Be Quiet, Mike!,</i> and two stories about the Patterson Puppies. She lives in Ketchum, Idaho.PreS&#x2014;A preschooler really loves Halloween, but readers see the duality of the holiday in a new and special way. There are the challenges of picking the perfect pumpkin and carving it, picking out a costume, and finding the courage to go trick-or-treating with Dad. The twofold plot is supported by the illustrations. For example, when the protagonist exclaims that he is "all clean," he actually is a complete mess from the guts of the pumpkin. Boo! is a fun and funny book that is a "safe" read for preschoolers because the happy-go-lucky toddler, with a single wiry strand of hair and pinkish glow, adds levity to a dark and scary night filled with ghosts and goblins. VERDICT Another winner for Patricelli. She has cleverly crafted a tale about a lovable preschooler celebrating another favorite holiday.&#x2014;Gwen Collier, Buffalo and Erie County Public Library, NY</p><h2>Streetwise Hawaii Map: Laminated Hawaii, Kauai, Maui, Molokai, Oahu &amp; Downtown Honolulu (Michelin Streetwise Maps)</h2><p><strong>REVISED 2019</strong><br><br><strong>Streetwise Hawaii Map</strong> - Laminated State Road Map of Hawaii - Folding pocket size travel map<br><br>This map covers the following areas:<br>Oahu Map 1:290,000<br>Downtown Honolulu &amp; Waikiki Map 1:23,000<br>Hawaii Map 1:750,000<br>Maui Map 1:350,000<br>Molokai Map 1:380,000<br>Kauai Map 1:320,000<br>Kailua-Kona Map 1:34,000<br>Hilo Map 1:75,000<br>Hawaiian Islands Map 1:8,300,000<br>Kahului Map 1:90,000<br><br>Aloha!

She believes that Sunday morning isn&#39;t a success if she has only managed to keep the kids quiet. And she knows there&#39;s more to church for kids than trying out their new coloring books. Children are at church for the same reason as their parents: for the privilege of worshiping God. Worship, Castleman writes, is &#34;the most important thing you can ever train your child to do.&#34; So with infectious passion, nitty-gritty advice and a touch of humor, she shows you how to help your children (from toddlers to teenagers) enter into worship. In this significantly revised and updated edition Castleman includes a new preface and two new appendices that provide new perspectives on children&#39;s sermon and intergenerational community. She also provides a study guide for personal reflection or group discussion. More than ever, Parenting in the Pew is essential reading for parents and worship leaders who want to help children make joyful noises unto the Lord.</p><p><strong>Robbie F. Castleman</strong> is professor of biblical studies and theology at John Brown University in Siloam Springs, Arkansas. She previously served for several years as a staff member with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. She has written a number of Bible studies and books, including <em>Story-Shaped Worship</em> (IVP Academic)."Castleman offers a beautiful vision of what worship can be like for both parents and children. In short, as the author says, worship for parents can become a process of saying, 'Daddy, I'd like you to meet my children.' Highly recommended." (Susan E. Richardson, Metro Christian Living, March 2013)<br><br>"Compelling reading. . . . Filled with good ideas, straightforward challenges, and true-to-life examples. It's a passionate call to spiritual parenting that reminds adults to actively participate in church services themselves while leading little ones into God's presence." (Bookstore Journal review of the expanded edition)<br><br>"Robbie Castleman does wonders in this book! She actually does show how 'training children to pay attention to God . . . is one rare way to have your cake and eat it too.' Her biblically grounded theology and experientially tested practical ideas give us wonderful suggestions that deepen our own participation in worship, even while we help children truly worship instead of merely keeping quiet. This book is essential--for pastors, Sunday school teachers, youth leaders, parents and every other member of the congregation (since we all are responsible for forming the church's offspring). The Christian community could be changed by this book; read it avidly and give it to everyone you know." (Marva J. Dawn, author of Keeping the Sabbath Wholly)<br><br>"<em>Parenting in the Pew</em> offers solid, practical solutions for parents who want to help their kids fully engage in Sunday morning worship. Castleman invites parents to see Sunday morning not as a challenge to keep their kids quiet, but as an opportunity to introduce their children to their heavenly Father." (Michael Ridgeway, managing editor, Thriving Family magazine)</p><h2>Heartsong (Green Creek)</h2><p>All Robbie Fontaine ever wanted was a place to belong. After the death of his mother, he bounces around from pack to pack, forming temporary bonds to keep from turning feral. It&#x2019;s enough&#x2014;until he receives a summons from the wolf stronghold in Caswell, Maine. Life as the trusted second to Michelle Hughes&#x2014;the Alpha of all&#x2014;and the cherished friend of a gentle old witch teaches Robbie what it means to be pack, to have a home. But when a mission from Michelle sends Robbie into the field, he finds himself questioning where he belongs and everything he&#x2019;s been told. Whispers of traitorous wolves and wild magic abound&#x2014;but who are the traitors and who the betrayed? More than anything, Robbie hungers for answers, because one of those alleged traitors is Kelly Bennett&#x2014;the wolf who may be his mate.The truth has a way of coming out. And when it does, everything will shatter.</p><p></p><h2>For The Sake Of America</h2><p>For The Sake Of America! Vision and word the LORD gave to three internationally recognized prophets who cried out to the LORD. They gave the facts to people they trusted and God arranged for each one to find and release them to Sheila. She realized the LORD was serious when the third message was shared by the Bob Jones contact after a wedding in May 2015. A three-week trip in October 2013 was already extended a few times. Only God knew the extension of time would be required to reveal such deep truth For the Sake of America! The LORD confirmed in a specific vision that He sent her to Georgia because she asked for the assignment. Since Georgia was not part of her conversations with the LORD she was a bit surprised until the LORD reminded her of her own words each time she witnessed the flow of the body of Christ in other nations He sent her to around the world. She hoped the LORD would send someone to bring the truth to the body of Christ in America. When the LORD reminded her of her heart&#39;s desire, she realized in that moment He sent her to Georgia to be available during this critical time in our nation for His purpose, plan and promise to be made known to the people. The LORD promised the prophets and Sheila if His people who are called by His name will stand in faith, humble themselves, repent for what He reveals to the body of Christ from Macon, Georgia to Moravian Falls, North Carolina then His truth will restore the people in Georgia and across America like a mighty flood.</p><p>God has taken Sheila around the world, church to church, business to business, nation to nation, set her before governors and kings without an extra coin or tunic. Many confirm she walks in the five-fold ministry. She does not use a title. She knows God does the work while He sends her as an apostle and prophet, and He orchestrates all arrangements for her to preach, teach, and evangelize. People attending conferences often say her segments are like watching someone walk out of the bible, share for a while and then, go right back in the bible, aka continue upon her journey in HIStory.</p><h2>Little Men (Puffin Classics)</h2><p>With two young sons of her own, and twelve rescued orphan boys filling the unusual school at Plumfield, Jo March - now Mrs Jo Bhaer - couldn&#39;t be happier. But the boys have a habit of getting into scrapes, and their mischievous antics call for the warm and affectionate support of the whole March family to help avoid disaster...</p><p>Louisa May Alcott (1832-88) was brought up in Pennsylvania, USA. She turned to writing in order to supplement the family income and had many short stories published in magazines and newspapers. Then, in 1862, during the height of the American Civil War, Louisa went to Georgetown to work as a nurse, but she contracted typhoid. Out of her experiences she wrote Hospital Sketches (1864) which won wide acclaim, followed by an adult novel, Moods. She was reluctant to write a children&#39;s book but then realized that in herself and her three sisters she had the perfect models. The result was Little Women (1868) which became the earliest American children&#39;s novel to become a classic&#34;Louisa May Alcott is the only author who remains both popular and literary today... Little Women was widely read, but its sequel Little Men even more so, perhaps because it was checked out by boys, too.&#34; * New York Times * &#34;Six generations of readers have found in the story of the March family universal truths about girls, families and growing up&#34; * Guardian * &#34;The best boys - in the literary sense - that we have ever come across&#34; * Spectator *</p><h2>Chinese for Beginners: Learning Conversational Chinese (Fully Romanized and Free Online Audio)</h2><p><b>This user-friendly guide to the basics helps you learn how to speak Chinese quickly and easily by drawing parallels with something you already know&#x2014;English.</b><br><br> Chinese is a fascinating language that can seem impossibly difficult to learn at first, but is relatively easy if you focus on the spoken aspect.

What I couldn&#x2019;t get out of my heart was this joy-grabbing stone I felt there. Partly because of these two thugs trailing me now, but more because I knew Jermaine wouldn&#x2019;t be here to protect my neck this time.</p><p>He would never, ever be coming home.</p><p>My daddy, Benny Rachpaul, had bought me these sneakers when I turned twelve over the summer. I wasn&#x2019;t about to let two older boys strolling down 125th Street snatch them off me.</p><p>Besides me being humiliated by it, my mother would whup my butt if she knew I had let some dudes swipe my shoes. And then, when he found out, Daddy Rachpaul would drive over and whup me again.</p><p>I flipped up the collar of my blue parka and continued down 125th Street, but rushed my step a little bit more. I heard the two boys following me quicken their pace. Their footsteps behind me crunched on the ice that much faster. My heart was beating faster too.</p><p>The streets around me were cheery, though. Harlem&#x2019;s main street was laid out tonight with bright lights, and Christmas tunes played constant on loudspeakers. I guess to put you more in the Christmas spirit.</p><p>But for me, there was nothing, and I mean nothing, that would ever make me feel Christmassy again. I was through with it.</p><p>Done.</p><p>Done with all of the Christmas music, wreaths, ornaments and happy holiday shoppers. I had decided weeks ago that I would never be happy again.</p><p>Because it wasn&#x2019;t fair.</p><p>Wasn&#x2019;t fair to get robbed of somebody I thought would be there for the rest of my life. Someone who was supposed to spend this Christmas with me, plus lots more Christmases!</p><p>It also wasn&#x2019;t fair that I couldn&#x2019;t even walk down 125th Street without being harassed. Rushing along down the sidewalk, I glanced up at all the men who were passing. All of them older and most of them Black like me. I was the youngest one out here and one of the few who felt scared to walk down this street.</p><p>For us young brothers, taking a stroll down here, even on Christmas Eve, was not relaxing at all. I felt like I had put my life on the line, straight up.</p><p>All of these old dudes lived in a different world from me.</p><p>I crossed the street and dipped into a gift shop on the corner. Grinning wide smiles, my two &#x201c;buddies&#x201d; waited for me outside, one of them sitting down on a fire hydrant and wiggling his fingers at me like I was a little infant in a stroller.</p><p>I sucked my teeth and turned toward the salesclerk.</p><p>&#x201c;Happy holidays, my young man,&#x201d; the clerk said. &#x201c;Help you find something?&#x201d; For a minute, his eyes peeped outside at the two boys waiting. He frowned at them.</p><p>I watched them leave and sighed with relief. The clerk cocked his bald head to one side.</p><p>&#x201c;I need a excellent Christmas gift,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;One for my mother, and another one for her, um, friend. And for my father. But I don&#x2019;t have much money.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Last-minute shoppers,&#x201d; he said, smiling at me. &#x201c;Come on. We&#x2019;ll get you straightened up. You&#x2019;re lucky we&#x2019;re open this late on Christmas Eve--125th Street is shutting down.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;###</p><p>125th is a big street that runs from the East River on the east side of Manhattan to the Hudson River on the west side of Manhattan. The street cuts right through the neighborhood of Harlem and is where most of the main stores and shops and businesses are. The Apollo Theater, the Adam Clayton Powell Building and the Studio Museum are all lined up along 1-2-5. If Harlem was a human body, then 125th would be its pumping heart, throbbing all the time.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know what the neighborhood&#x2019;s brain would be.</p><p>As I flew back toward home, I suddenly realized how heavy the gifts were that I had just bought in that shop. Ma and Yvonne would both be happy, I hoped. And Daddy, with his gift too.</p><p>But the bag handle cut into my fingers.</p><p>And just as I switched the plastic shopping bag to my other hand, I saw them. Across the wide blacktopped, slushy street, those two older boys had caught sight of me again. I started to step even faster down 125th Street, toward St. Nick, hoping I could make it to the border before they could catch me.</p><p>Where I live, it&#x2019;s all about borders.</p><p>And territories.</p><p>And crews.</p><p>When you&#x2019;re a little kid in Harlem, you can pretty much go anywhere and do anything as long as you&#x2019;re careful. But when you start to get old--about my age, twelve--things start to change.</p><p>You can&#x2019;t go everywhere.</p><p>You got to start worrying about crews. Crews are like cliques. Groups of mostly boys, and sometimes females, who hang out together. Mostly for fun, but for protection too.</p><p>And each crew got its territory in their neighborhood. And if you ain&#x2019;t from that hood, or a member of that set, you need to stay out.</p><p>When I was young, I used to have a friend over on East 127th Street. His name was Cody. We used to play boxball and dodgeball on East 127th all the time, even though I lived on the West Side.</p><p>Nowadays when I see Cody and he&#x2019;s with his crew, we don&#x2019;t talk at all. He just glares at me like I&#x2019;m about to get jumped. He does it because we live in different places and we&#x2019;re old now.</p><p>That&#x2019;s how crews work.</p><p>So tonight, when I finally turned off of 125th and onto Eighth Av&#x2019;, the boys following me had to stop right there. There wasn&#x2019;t no real roadblock set up for them. If they had really wanted to, they could&#x2019;a kept on following me, right up the block and straight into St. Nick projects.</p><p>But if they&#x2019;d done that, somebody would&#x2019;a jumped them boys.</p><p>Or worse.</p><p>&nbsp;###&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yo, whattup, Lolly,&#x201d; Concrete said to me when I walked up the path into St. Nick. We slapped hands. &#x201c;Lolly Rachpaul,&#x201d; he said again.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, &#x2019;Crete,&#x201d; I said to him. &#x201c;How Day-Day?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He fine,&#x201d; Concrete said. &#x201c;Thanks for asking. How your moms?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She fine,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Merry Christmas!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yo, man, I don&#x2019;t celebrate White Jesus Day no more!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;This is the holiday of the Oppressor.&#x201d;</p><p>Concrete, about thirty, was ten years older than what Jermaine would&#x2019;a been. &#x2019;Crete was what we called him. I didn&#x2019;t even know what his real name was, and he probably didn&#x2019;t know that my real name wasn&#x2019;t Lolly, which is what everybody called me.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry, man,&#x201d; I told him.</p><p>&#x2019;Crete didn&#x2019;t even live in St. Nick, but he was always there, hanging around the big courtyard at its center. As far back as I remember, he had always been in that courtyard, peddling weed. He was a dealer, or &#x201c;street pharmacist.&#x201d;</p><p>The place where I lived, the St. Nicholas Houses--otherwise known as the projects--was like a big family. Just like in a real family, you got some &#x201c;relatives&#x201d; you&#x2019;re cool with and others you can&#x2019;t stand, or who act up all the time.</p><p>St. Nick Houses was just like that.</p><p>It was home.</p><p>I got to my building, where I lived with my moms, walked in through the broken door and took the steps, because our elevator was jacked up too--the city didn&#x2019;t never fix nothing.</p><p>Seven flights of stairs!</p><p>About half the way up, the stairwell got all dark. The lights on this floor had burnt out, meaning I had to be careful climbing stairs in the gloominess.</p><p>Being in the dark forced my brain to concentrate more on the smell, which was mostly laid-over pee. You got used to it, though, the pee smell.</p><p>Just then, I raised one foot up and hit something. Something big and lumpy. The big lump jumped and clubbed my leg.</p><p>I stumbled back and almost tripped down the stairs, until I realized the big lump was Moses. Who was a old drunk man. When it was real cold outside, like it was tonight, he sometimes slept in the stairs.</p><p>Until the kids ran him out of here.</p><p>Or the cops.</p><p>&#x201c;Merry Christmas, old drunk,&#x201d; I said to him.</p><p>&#x201c;Show respect, boy!&#x201d; he shouted after me. &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t no drunk. I only booze it up twice a year--&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I know, Moses: when it&#x2019;s your birthday and when it&#x2019;s not your birthday.&#x201d;</p><p>His jokes, I&#x2019;d heard them all before.</p><p>Moses cackled like a old witch in the darkness while I continued climbing stairs.</p></p><h2>Guant�namo Diary: Restored Edition</h2><p><b>The acclaimed national bestseller, the first and only diary written by a Guant�namo detainee during his imprisonment, now with previously censored material restored.<br><br></b>When GUANT�NAMO DIARY was first published--heavily redacted by the U.S. government--in 2015, Mohamedou Ould Slahi was still imprisoned at the detainee camp in Guant�namo Bay, Cuba, despite a federal court ruling ordering his release, and it was unclear when or if he would ever see freedom. In October 2016, he was finally released and reunited with his family. During his 14-year imprisonment, the United States never charged him with a crime.<br><br>Now for the first time, he is able to tell his story in full, with previously censored material restored. This searing diary is not merely a vivid record of a miscarriage of justice, but a deeply personal memoir---terrifying, darkly humorous, and surprisingly gracious. GUANT�NAMO DIARY is a document of immense emotional power and historical importance.</p><p><strong>Mohamedou Slahi</strong> was born in Mauritania in 1970. In 2001, he was detained and rendered to a prison in Jordan, then to Afghanistan, and finally to the U.S. prison at Guant�namo Bay, Cuba, where he was subjected to severe torture. He was cleared and released on October 16, 2016 and repatriated to his native country of Mauritania.

In 1612, Mogul emperor Shah Jahan married Mumtaz Mahal. It had been love at first sight and for nineteen years they were so inseparable that Mumtaz even accompanied Shah Jahan to battlefields. When she died suddenly giving birth to their fourteenth child, the emperor set about building a magnificent memorial to his wife. Everything about the Taj was perfectly planned, from the white marble walls that shimmer in the sunlight and sparkle by moonlight, to the countless decorative flowers made from precious gems that still astound visitors today. Recent discoveries at the site make this a timely account of a timeless monument.</p><p>Dorothy and Thomas Hoobler have written many books for children and young adults, including <i>Where Are the Great Pyramids?</i> Their YA mystery, <i>In Darkness, Death,</i> won the Edgar Award.<b>Where Is the Taj Mahal?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Each year more than two million visitors arrive in the city of Agra, India. Some have traveled from the other side of the world. They have come to see one of the world&#x2019;s most famous buildings.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Taj Mahal.<br> &nbsp;<br> Its white marble dome shimmers in sunlight and sparkles when the moon shines. Many believe it is the most beautiful building in the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Taj does not stand alone. It is part of a group of buildings and gardens that occupies forty-two acres. It stands on the banks of the Yamuna River, a major river of northern India.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> People who don&#x2019;t know anything about the Taj Mahal may think it is a palace. But it was not built for people to live in. The Taj is a tomb. It contains the bodies of a ruler named Shah Jahan and his wife Mumtaz Mahal. The name Taj Mahal is a shortened form of her name.<br> &nbsp;<br> Shah Jahan adored his wife. When she died giving birth to their fourteenth child, Shah Jahan vowed to build a magnificent tomb that would show his undying love for her . . . and he did.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1</b>: <b>A Joyous Childhood</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The ruler later known as Shah Jahan was the fifth emperor of the Mogul dynasty, which ruled much of what is present-day India from 1526 to 1858. At its height of power, the Mogul Empire included parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan.<br> &nbsp;<br> The first six rulers of the Mogul Empire were probably the richest in the world at that time. European travelers spread the stories of the Moguls&#x2019; fabulous wealth and power. The rulers of Europe admired the splendor and luxury of the Moguls. In the 1600s and 1700s the term &#x201c;Great Mogul&#x201d; meant the kind of powerful ruler that European monarchs wanted to be as well.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Moguls&#x2019; reputation for wealth made the name <i>mogul</i> a synonym for a wealthy person&#x2014;as it still is today. Those who reach great success in business, and particularly the movie industry, are called moguls.<br> &nbsp;<br> As for Shah Jahan, everything about his birth in 1592 seemed lucky. The year was 1000 in the Islamic calendar, and the month was the same month as Muhammad&#x2019;s birthday. (Muhammad was the prophet who began the religion of Islam.)<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> At his birth, the future emperor was given the name Khurram. It meant &#x201c;joyous.&#x201d; Just before he was born, a fortune-teller made a prediction to his grandfather&#x2019;s first wife, Ruqaiya. He said that this child would have a great future and be &#x201c;more resplendent than the sun.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ruqaiya had no children of her own. She wanted to raise a future emperor. So when Khurram was six days old, he was taken from his mother and given to Ruqaiya. The mother was paid with rubies and pearls for her loss. From then on Ruqaiya was in charge of the child&#x2019;s upbringing.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Like all the children and grandchildren of the Mogul ruler, Khurram grew up in the palace harem. (The word <i>harem</i> comes from an Arabic word meaning &#x201c;sacred&#x201d; or &#x201c;forbidden.&#x201d;) This was where the women and children of the household stayed, apart from men. The emperor&#x2019;s wives lived there, along with his mother, aunts, nieces, and young children. Female servants lived there, too. Even the harem guards were women who were trained to use a bow and arrow. The only grown man to enter was the emperor himself. He slept there. It was also where he kept his most important papers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Khurram&#x2019;s education began when he was four years, four months, and four days old. (Four was considered a lucky number.) He went to school in a mosque (an Islamic house of worship). He studied religion, arts, literature, and history. He learned all about his family and Mogul ancestors.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> From a young age, Khurram loved beautiful things. He liked to drench himself and his clothes with perfume and play with precious gems. But he also learned how to be a warrior. Hunting and fighting were part of his life as well.<br> &nbsp;<br> Khurram was always close to his grandfather Akbar, the emperor. Akbar took him to battles to improve his skills with a bow and to learn to ride a horse. At the age of nine, the boy was allowed to join the war council.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> When Akbar lay dying, Khurram refused to leave his bedside. Nine days after Akbar&#x2019;s death, Khurram&#x2019;s father was proclaimed emperor in the Red Fort at Agra.

This epistle provides Paul&#x2019;s most direct address about the life that emerges from a disciple of Jesus. Paul conveys his pastoral heart for the Ephesian believers by focusing upon who they are in Christ as it relates to their struggles, their new life, community, pursuits of unity and holiness, and life&#x2019;s many challenges. Perhaps the most contemporary book in the New Testament, Ephesians offers practical answers to basic questions about the Christian life and our identity in Christ. This six-session study will help students better understand both the importance of finding identity in Christ, and the relationship between our spiritual adoption and our daily lifestyle.<br><br><b>Member Workbook</b>&nbsp;includes a small-group experience for 6 small-group sessions, individual study opportunities for each day of the week, applicable Scripture, &#x201c;How To Use This Study,&#x201d; and a group discussion guide.

Even as a child, she never doubted this. Location matters in destiny as much as it does in real estate.<br> <br>In Gliwice, it was every girl&#x2019;s birthright to take ballet. The ballet teacher there was Miss Gosia, a former celebrated prima ballerina for the Polish National Ballet prior to Russian martial law, and because of this, it was considered a perk to raise daughters in otherwise grim Gliwice, an unrivaled privilege that every young girl would have access to such an accomplished teacher. These girls grew up wearing leotards and buns and tulle-spun hopes of pirouetting their way out of Gliwice someday. Without knowing specifically what has become of the girls who grew up in Gliwice, she&#x2019;s sure that most, if not all, remain firmly anchored where they began and are now schoolteachers or miners&#x2019; wives whose unrequited ballerina dreams have been passed on to their daughters, the next generation of Miss Gosia&#x2019;s students.<br> <br>If Karina had grown up in Gliwice, she would most certainly not have become a ballerina. She has horrible feet, wide, clumsy flippers with virtually no arch, a sturdy frame cast on a long torso and short legs, a body built more for milking cows than for pas de bourr�e. She would never have been Miss Gosia&#x2019;s star pupil. Karina&#x2019;s parents would have put an end to bartering valuable coal and eggs for ballet lessons long before pointe shoes. Had her life started in Gliwice, she&#x2019;d still be in Gliwice.<br> <br>The girls down the road in Bytom had no ballet lessons. The children in Bytom had the Catholic Church. The boys were groomed for the priesthood, the girls the convent. Karina might have become a nun had she grown up in Bytom. Her parents would&#x2019;ve been so proud. Maybe her life would be content and honorable had she chosen God.<br> <br>But her life was never really a choice. She grew up in Zabrze, and in Zabrze lived Mr. Borowitz, the town&#x2019;s piano teacher. He didn&#x2019;t have a prestigious pedigree like Miss Gosia&#x2019;s or a professional studio. Lessons were taught in his living room, which reeked of cat piss, yellowing books, and cigarettes. But Mr. Borowitz was a fine teacher. He was dedicated, stern but encouraging, and most important, he taught every one of his pupils to play Chopin. In Poland, Chopin is as revered as Pope John Paul II and God. Poland&#x2019;s Holy Trinity.<br> <br>Karina wasn&#x2019;t born with the lithe body of a ballerina, but she was graced with the strong arms and long fingers of a pianist. She still remembers her first lesson with Mr. Borowitz. She was five. The glossy keys, the immediacy of pleasing sound, the story of the notes told by her fingers. She took to it instantly. Unlike most children, she never had to be ordered to practice. Quite the opposite, she had to be told to stop. Stop playing, and do your homework. Stop playing, and set the dinner table. Stop playing, it&#x2019;s time for bed. She couldn&#x2019;t resist playing. She still can&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Ultimately, piano became her ticket out of oppressive Poland, to Curtis and America and everything after. Everything after. That single decision&#x2014;to learn piano&#x2014;set everything that was to follow in motion, the ball in her life&#x2019;s Rube Goldberg machine. She wouldn&#x2019;t be here, right now, attending Hannah Chu&#x2019;s graduation party, had she never played piano.<br> <br>She parks her Honda behind a Mercedes, the last in a conga line of cars along the side of the road at least three blocks from Hannah&#x2019;s house, assuming this is the closest she&#x2019;ll get. She checks the clock on the dash. She&#x2019;s a half hour late. Good. She&#x2019;ll make a brief appearance, offer her congratulations, and leave.<br> <br>Her heels click against the street as she walks, a human metronome, and her thoughts continue in pace with this rhythm. Without piano, she would never have met Richard. What would her life be like had she never met him? How many hours has she spent indulging in this fantasy? If added up, the hours would accumulate into days and weeks, possibly more. More time wasted. What could&#x2019;ve been. What will never be.<br> <br>Maybe she would&#x2019;ve been satisfied had she never left her home country to pursue piano. She&#x2019;d still be living with her parents, sleeping in her childhood bedroom. Or she&#x2019;d be married to a boring man from Zabrze, a coal miner who earns a hard but respectable living, and she&#x2019;d be a homemaker, raising their five children. Both wretched scenarios appeal to her now for a commonality she hates to acknowledge: a lack of loneliness.<br> <br>Or what if she had attended Eastman instead of Curtis? She almost did. That single, arbitrary choice. She would never have met Richard. She would never have taken a step back, assuming with the arrogant and immortal optimism of a twenty-five-year-old that she&#x2019;d have another chance, that the Wheel of Fortune&#x2019;s spin would once again tick to a stop with its almighty arrow pointing directly at her. She&#x2019;d waited years for another turn. Sometimes life gives you only one.<br> <br>But then, if she&#x2019;d never met Richard, their daughter, Grace, wouldn&#x2019;t be here. Karina imagines an alternative reality in which her only daughter was never conceived and catches herself enjoying the variation almost to the point of wishing for it. She scolds herself, ashamed for allowing such a horrible thought. She loves Grace more than anything else. But the truth is, having Grace was another critical, fork-in-the-road, Gliwice-versus-Bytom-versus-Zabrze moment. Left brought Grace and tied Karina to Richard, the rope tight around her neck like a leash or a noose, depending on the day, for the next seventeen years. Right was the path not chosen. Who knows where that might&#x2019;ve led?<br> <br>Regret shadows her every step, a dog at her heels, as she now follows the winding stone path into the Chu family&#x2019;s backyard. Hannah was accepted to Notre Dame, her first choice. Another piano student off to college. Hannah won&#x2019;t continue with piano there. Like most of Karina&#x2019;s students, Hannah took lessons because she wanted to add &#x201c;plays piano&#x201d; to her college application. The parents have the same motive, often exponentially more intense and unapologetic. So Hannah went through the motions, and their weekly half hour together was a soulless chore for both student and teacher.<br> <br>A rare few of Karina&#x2019;s students authentically like playing, and a couple even have talent and potential, but none of them love it enough to pursue it. You have to love it. She can&#x2019;t blame them. These kids are all overscheduled, stressed-out, and too focused on getting into &#x201c;the best&#x201d; college to allow the nourishment passion needs to grow. A flower doesn&#x2019;t blossom from a seed without the persistent love of sun and water.<br> <br>But Hannah isn&#x2019;t just one of Karina&#x2019;s piano students. Hannah was Grace&#x2019;s closest friend from the age of six through middle school. Playdates, sleepovers, Girl Scouts, soccer, trips to the mall and the movies&#x2014;for most of Grace&#x2019;s childhood, Hannah was like a younger sister. When Grace moved up to the high school and Hannah remained in middle school, the girls migrated naturally into older and younger social circles. There was never a falling-out. Instead, the friends endured a passive drifting on calm currents to separate but neighboring islands. They visited from time to time.<br> <br>Hannah&#x2019;s graduation milestone shouldn&#x2019;t mean much to Karina, but it feels monumental, as if she&#x2019;s sustaining a bigger loss than another matriculated piano student. It trips the switch of memories from this time last year, and it&#x2019;s the end of Grace&#x2019;s childhood all over again. Karina leaves her card for Hannah on the gift table and sighs.<br> <br>Even though Hannah&#x2019;s at the far end of the expansive backyard, Karina spots her straightaway, standing on the edge of the diving board, laughing, a line of wet girls and boys behind her, mostly boys in the pool, cheering her name, goading her to do something. Karina waits to see what it will be. Hannah launches into the air and cannonballs into the water, splashing the parents gathered near the pool. The parents complain, wiping water from their arms and faces, but they&#x2019;re smiling. It&#x2019;s a hot day, and the momentary spray probably felt refreshing. Karina notices Hannah&#x2019;s mom, Pam, among them.<br> <br>Now that Hannah is moving to Indiana, Karina assumes she won&#x2019;t see Pam at all anymore. They stopped their Thursday-night wine dates some time ago, not long after Grace started high school. Over the past couple of years, their friendship dwindled to the handful of unfulfilling moments before or after Hannah&#x2019;s weekly piano lesson. Tasked with shuttling her three kids to and from a dizzying schedule of extracurricular activities all over town, Pam was often too rushed to even come inside and waited for Hannah in her running car. Karina waved to her from the front door every Tuesday at 5:30 as Pam pulled away.<br> <br>Karina almost didn&#x2019;t come today. She feels self-conscious about showing up alone. Naturally introverted, she&#x2019;d been extremely private about her marriage and even more shut-in about her divorce. Assuming Richard didn&#x2019;t air their dirty laundry either, and that&#x2019;s a safe bet, no one knows the details. So the gossip mill scripted the drama it wasn&#x2019;t supplied. Someone has to be right, and someone has to be wrong. Based on the hushed stares, vanished chitchat, and pulled plastic smiles, Karina knows how she&#x2019;s been cast.<br> <br>The women in particular sympathize with him. Of course they do. They paint him as a sainted celebrity. He deserves to be with someone more elegant, someone who appreciates how extraordinary he is, someone more his equal. They assume she&#x2019;s jealous of his accomplishments, resentful of his acclaim, bitter about his fame. She&#x2019;s nothing but a rinky-dink suburban piano teacher instructing disinterested sixteen-year-olds on how to play Chopin. She clearly doesn&#x2019;t have the self-esteem to be the wife of such a great man.<br> <br>They don&#x2019;t know. They don&#x2019;t know a damn thing.<br> <br>Grace just finished her freshman year at the University of Chicago. Karina had anticipated that Grace would be home for the summer by now and would be at Hannah&#x2019;s party, but Grace decided to stay on campus through the summer, interning on a project with her math professor. Something about statistics. Karina&#x2019;s proud of her daughter for being selected for the internship and thinks it&#x2019;s a great opportunity, and yet, there&#x2019;s that pang in Karina&#x2019;s stomach, the familiar letdown. Grace could&#x2019;ve chosen to come home, to spend the summer with her mother, but she didn&#x2019;t. Karina knows it&#x2019;s ridiculous to feel slighted, forsaken even, but her emotions sit on the throne of her intellect. This is how she&#x2019;s built, and like any castle, her foundational stones aren&#x2019;t easily rearranged.<br> <br>Her divorce became absolute in September of Grace&#x2019;s senior year, and exactly one year later, Grace moved a thousand miles away. First Richard left. Then Grace. Karina wonders when she&#x2019;ll get used to the silence in her home, the emptiness, the memories that hang in each room as real as the artwork on the walls. She misses her daughter&#x2019;s voice chatting on the phone; her giggling girlfriends; her shoes in every room; her hair elastics, towels, and clothes on the floor; the lights left on. She misses her daughter.<br> <br>She does not miss Richard. When he moved out, his absence felt more like a new presence than a subtraction. The sweet calm that took up residence after he left filled more space than his human form and colossal ego ever did. She did not miss him then or now.<br> <br>But going to these kinds of family events alone, without a husband, tilts her off-balance as if she were one cheek atop a two-legged stool. So in that sense, she misses him. For the stability. She&#x2019;s forty-five and divorced. Single. In Poland, she&#x2019;d be considered a disgrace. But she&#x2019;s been in America now for over half her life. Her situation is common in this secular culture and imposes no shame. Yet, she feels ashamed. You can take the girl out of Poland, but you can&#x2019;t take Poland out of the girl.<br> <br>Not recognizing any of the other parents, she takes a deep breath and begins the long, awkward walk alone over to Pam. Karina spent an absurdly long time getting ready for this party. Which dress, which shoes, which earrings? She blew out her hair. She even got a manicure yesterday. For what? It&#x2019;s not as if she&#x2019;s trying to impress Hannah or Pam or any of the parents. And it&#x2019;s not as if there will be any single men here, not that she&#x2019;s looking for a man anyway.<br> <br>She knows why. She&#x2019;ll be damned if anyone here looks at her and thinks, Poor Karina. Her life&#x2019;s a mess, and she looks it, too. The other reason is Richard. Pam and Scott Chu are his friends, too. Richard was probably invited. She could&#x2019;ve asked Pam if Richard was on the guest list&#x2014;not that it mattered, just to be forewarned&#x2014;but she chickened out.<br> <br>So there it is, the stomach-turning possibility that he might be here, and the even more putrid thought that he might show up with the latest skinny little twentysomething tart hanging on his arm and every self-important word. Karina rubs her lips together, making sure her lipstick hasn&#x2019;t clumped.<br> <br>Her eyes poke around the yard. He&#x2019;s not standing with Pam and the cluster of parents by the pool house. Karina scans the pool, the grilling island, the lawn. She doesn&#x2019;t see him.<br> <br>She arrives at the pool house and inserts herself into the circle of Pam and Scott and other parents. Their voices instantly drop, their eyes conspiring.

He&#x2019;s canceled gigs and touring dates before. Once, he couldn&#x2019;t stand the conductor and refused to set foot onstage with him. Another time, Richard had to be replaced last minute because he got drunk at an airport bar and missed his flight. She wonders what reason he has this time. But Pam and Scott and the others stare at her with grave expressions, as if she should have something more compassionate to say on the subject.<br> <br>Her stomach floods with emotion, her inner streets crowding fast as a fervent protest stands upon its soapbox in her center, outraged that she has to deal with this, that Pam especially can&#x2019;t be more sensitive to her. Richard&#x2019;s canceled tour isn&#x2019;t her concern. She divorced him. His life isn&#x2019;t her problem anymore.<br> <br>&#x201c;You really don&#x2019;t know?&#x201d; asks Pam.<br> <br>They all wait for her answer, lips shut, bodies still, an audience engrossed in watching a play.<br> <br>&#x201c;What? What, is he dying or something?&#x201d;<br> <br>A nervous half-laugh escapes her, and the sound finds no harmony. She searches the circle of parents for connection, even if the comment was slightly inappropriate, for someone to forgive her a bit of dark humor. But everyone either looks horrified or away. Everyone but Pam.

The women in these stories live lives of privilege and of poverty, are in marriages both loving and haunted by past crimes or emotional blackmail. A pair of sisters have been inseparable ever since they were abducted together as children, and, grown now, must negotiate the elder sister&#x2019;s marriage. A woman married to a twin pretends not to realize when her husband and his brother impersonate each other. A stripper putting herself through college fends off the advances of an overzealous customer. A black engineer moves to Upper Michigan for a job and faces the malign curiosity of her colleagues and the difficulty of leaving her past behind. From a girls&#x2019; fight club to a wealthy subdivision in Florida where neighbors conform, compete, and spy on each other, Gay gives voice to a chorus of unforgettable women in a scintillating collection reminiscent of Merritt Tierce, Anne Enright, and Miranda July.</p><p><b>Roxane Gay</b> is the author of the novel <i>An Untamed State</i>; the essay collection <i>Bad Feminist</i>; and <i>Ayiti</i>, a multi-genre collection.

In the tradition of <i>When Sophie Gets Angry&#x2014;Really, Really Angry</i> and <i>Sometimes I&#x2019;m Bombaloo</i>, <i>Allie All Along</i> explores simple ways kids can center themselves in the face of overwhelming emotions.

Her big brother works to help her calm down, giving her a pillow to punch, a toy to squeeze and suggestions to take deep breaths and count backward. As she successfully applies each tactic, gradually reducing her rage, she sheds the brightly colored fur skins that represent her feelings. By the time &#x2018;the rest of the angry [falls] away,&#x2019; there's just one slightly forlorn little girl in pigtails standing in the room, asking her brother for a hug. &#x2018;I knew she was in there all along,&#x2019; he says. Sarah Lynne Reul's (<i>The Breaking News</i>) illustrations are brilliantly evocative of each mood as Allie cools down, and the language she uses provides readers with a veritable thesaurus of vocabulary words for angry feelings: &#x2018;ferocious,&#x2019; &#x2018;fierce,&#x2019; &#x2018;irritable.&#x2019; And the labels on the crayons in the inside front cover give a poetic flavor to emotions: &#x2018;fire fury explosion red,&#x2019; &#x2018;raging flame orange,&#x2019; &#x2018;simmering green storm&#x2019; and the infamous broken &#x2018;deep down blue.&#x2019; Children who are still trying to find words for their own powerful feelings will love seeing Allie's moods reflected in colors and should even pick up a few anger management tips from her wise, loving older brother. Inside the back cover the venomous crayon color labels are no longer visible, and the previously broken blue crayon is now taped together. Almost as good as new, just like Allie! &#x201c;<i>Allie All Along</i> deserves a spot on the shelf with <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i>, <i>When Sophie Gets Angry--Really, Really Angry...</i> and <i>My Mouth Is a Volcano</i>.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Shelf Awareness</i><br><br> &#x201c;When Allie&#x2019;s crayon snaps in half, the toddler goes into a red-monster rage, smashing and screaming, until her brother calmly coaches her to punch a pillow. When her rage simmers down to a fiery orange, he offers her favorite toy to squeeze; and then, even when she can&#x2019;t remember what she was angry about, he has her take a deep breath and pretend his fingers are candles to blow out one by one. Finally, counting backward reveals an abashed brown-skinned child asking for a hug from a wise older brother who &#x2018;knew she was in there all along.&#x2019; The artistic rendering of Allie as a color-changing monster is a multidimensional way of visually representing anger to young children while giving them skills to cope and eventually learn to calm themselves. Reul uses language economically, making this ideal for the audience but still powerful enough for discussing emotions at any age.

Let these stories inspire you to find your path to strength and achievement along whatever path you take.<br></p><p><b>Dan Gable</b> has been named to several Halls of Fame including the USA Wrestling Hall of Fame, the US Olympic Hall of Fame, the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, and is the namesake of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame Dan Gable Museum in Waterloo, Iowa. In 2002, he was appointed to the President&#x2019;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. He has been named the top wrestler of the 20th Century by Gannett News Services, is listed as one of the top coaches of the 20th Century by ESPN, and is named Iowa&#x2019;s top sports figure in the past 100 years. In 1996, Gable was named one of the &#x201c;100 Golden Olympians,&#x201d; an honor bestowed to the top 100 U.S. Olympians of all time. During the 2012 Olympics, he was inducted into the FILA Hall of Fame Legends of the Sport category, becoming one of three people in the world to receive this honor. He resides in Iowa City, Iowa, with his wife Kathy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Born and raised in Connecticut, <b>Scott Schulte</b> has been a fan of Dan Gable his entire life.

He&#x2019;s been a primary inspiration to me since I was 15, and this book will show you why. In a modern world of political correctness and glad handing, the art of the fight is highly undervalued.

As more research has emerged showing a clear link between our mental and physical state and lifestyle factors and our ability to avoid and survive cancer and other diseases, even the more skeptical within the medical community have begun to take notice. Over the years, more times than I can count, cancer doctors across all disciplines have confided in me that they have long suspected that their patients' mental state and lifestyle plays an important role in their ability to survive a cancer diagnosis and restore themselves to wellness. What is becoming increasingly evident based on solid science and our improved ability to measure and document the biological effects of lifestyle changes is this: comprehensive lifestyle change, combined with conventional cancer care, is powerful medicine that can help control, and potentially prevent, cancer.<br><br>Living with Cancer<br><br>Once, a cancer diagnosis was basically a death sentence. Although it could, with a lot of medical might, be beaten back, it would rarely be defeated. Over the past couple of decades, however, this has begun to change. Cancer is now, for many, considered a serious, chronic disease. What this means in practical terms is that more people are living longer with cancer. And this is very good news. But survival raises new questions: Are these people who are living longer with cancer better feeling!-healthy and well-even if they are not cured?<br><br>Some oncologists might wonder why, if the patient is surviving, this question is relevant at all. In my area of expertise, the world of integrative medicine, this question is everything. I spend my workdays helping cancer patients make choices so that they will feel healthy-even as they undergo difficult, sometimes debilitating, treatments-because it's precisely these lifestyle changes that will also increase their odds of survival. And while I focus on their quality of life, my colleagues continue to better understand how cancer cells work, guiding the move from a one-size-fits-all approach to more nuanced, personal treatment. Much of this shift from a "hit it hard and fast" mind-set to more of what is being called "precision medicine" is due to the relatively recent breakthroughs we've made in understanding how our genes and cells work. We're also developing and harnessing technologies that allow us to detect many cancers earlier-and the earlier a cancer is found, the better the prognosis and treatment outcome.<br><br>These innovations are incredibly important, and alongside these advancements are exciting discoveries being made not by scientists in labs or surgeons in operating room suites but by regular people in their kitchens and homes; on jogging trails; and in grocery stores, yoga studios, gyms, and wellness centers. Everyday lifestyle choices give us a surprising amount of control and influence over the trajectory of a cancer diagnosis and of our cancer risk. By making simple changes to the way we live, we can diminish the side effects of conventional cancer treatments, extend (and sometimes shatter) expected survival rates, decrease the chance for recurrence of disease, and potentially prevent the onset of cancer diseases in the first place. It's an exciting time to be in the realm of integrative care, but it took us a very long time to reach this point, and it's taking even longer to get the word out that lifestyle change is legitimate, effective medicine to help prevent and control cancer.<br><br>Are the Odds Really Stacked Against Us?<br><br>During the last fifty years, tremendous advances have been made in frontline treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. These treatments, along with the innovative developments in targeted therapies (aimed at the abnormal proteins controlling cancer growth) and immunotherapy, have saved or prolonged the lives of millions of people. In fact, our success rate at keeping people alive after a cancer diagnosis is better than ever.<br><br>Yet despite these medical advances, nearly 1.7 million Americans are projected to receive a cancer diagnosis in 2017. During that same twelve-month period, cancer will claim the lives of more than six hundred thousand people in the United States. Around the world, cancer remains a leading cause of death, and new cases are expected to increase by 70 percent in the next two decades. In 2015, the disease took the lives of 8.8 million people globally.<br><br>Based on current models, one-third of all American women and half of all American men will receive a cancer diagnosis in their lifetimes. Worldwide, nearly one out of every six deaths is due to cancer. This means that the odds are extremely high that both you and I will one day join the more than 15.5 million Americans who are currently living with cancer and the tens of millions of cancer survivors around the world.<br><br>Given these staggering numbers, it's unlikely that we'll eliminate cancer anytime soon, though this will not stop us from trying. Also unlikely is the discovery of one drug or treatment-a magic bullet-that will eradicate this increasingly complex range of diseases. What is more likely-as we are beginning to see now-is that we'll continue to understand how cancer cells respond to various stimuli and learn to slow or "turn off" their progression. Similarly, we hope to better understand the processes that trigger cancer's growth and target them with effective treatment. We're already seeing compelling evidence that lifestyle factors may be the missing ingredient of the existing cancer treatment model.<br><br>Cancer, first and foremost, is a disease of aging: our odds of getting most cancers rises significantly each decade we live past the age of fifty. This puts us in a bit of quandary, since we are-thanks in no small part to modern medicine-living longer and longer lives. The onset of diseases such as cancer adds a terrible burden to the already great challenges of aging, as our cells become more vulnerable to damage and corruption.<br><br>Although most cancers strike when we're older, there are some types (including colorectal and breast cancers) that are striking people at increasingly younger ages, and these cancers are often quite aggressive and fiercely resistant to treatment. In fact, recent data suggest that younger people are not only being diagnosed with colon cancer more than ever before but also dying of the disease in higher and higher numbers. Some childhood cancers are also on the rise.<br><br>So far, the medical establishment's response to the uptick appearing in the young has been to call for earlier screening, which is, of course, a prudent place to start. But early detection, we've found, isn't always the best or only answer. There are instances of early detection with some cancers, such as early-stage, low-grade prostate cancer and very-early-stage breast cancer, that lead to overtreatment with no demonstrable survival benefits. In fact, the current recommendations have changed from "all men over fifty need to be screened to prostate cancer" to "all men over fifty should have a conversation with their physician about prostate screening." Could there, then, be a better way to prevent or delay the onset of cancers, including the aggressive types that seem to strike people so young? I believe the answer is yes.<br><br>Current cancer statistics can be sobering, even frightening, but the larger picture offers good news. There has been a positive, almost radical shift in cancer survival rates. Fifty years ago, only one in four Americans survived cancer for more than a decade; today that ratio is one in two-a doubling in overall survival rates. Is this because treatments and technologies have improved? In part, yes. Absolutely. But now we're beginning to understand that medical advances are not the only reason for improved outcomes.<br><br>Still, it is the unpredictable nature of cancer that often makes us feel powerless. Despite all we know of the disease and all the money that has gone into research and treatment, cancer has a way of defying our expectations and striking those who seem least likely candidates for a diagnosis. There is the singer who never smoked a day in her life who is diagnosed with lung cancer. Or the vegan runner who has been lean and fit his whole life and prides himself on his "clean" diet, only to be diagnosed young with stage IV colon cancer. And, most cruelly, there is the very young child who must battle an aggressive form of leukemia before she even has the words to describe what it all feels like. Why is it, we can't help but wonder, that my body, anybody's body, would let this happen? What could trigger such an awful disease within us?<br><br>It is perfectly normal to run the gauntlet of these thoughts and feelings and ask ourselves all these questions, but it is even more important that we don't beat ourselves up or blame or shame ourselves into resignation or passivity. Meg Hirshberg is a friend, breast cancer survivor, and the founder of the Anticancer Lifestyle Program, a nonprofit, evidence-based lifestyle program for people diagnosed with cancer. She recently spoke to me about why it's so important to resist blaming yourself if you get cancer: "Our message is always, 'Begin now. Don't look back. We have no idea what caused your cancer and we never will. But we do know that there are things you can do differently that will make a radical difference in how you feel. There is also scientific evidence that shows how these lifestyle changes will positively influence the results of your treatment.'" For Meg and the people who go through her program, this forward focus is accompanied by active education about the healing power of making lifestyle changes and the healing benefits of a loving community. As she continues, "Knowledge is power and, where cancer is concerned, knowledge has the power to enable survivors to lower the odds of cancer recurrence. There is data to back this up and we want to share that science with our community in ways that make people feel more hopeful, more powerful, more inspired, and more alive."</p><h2>Histamine Intolerance Explained: 12 Steps To Building a Healthy Low Histamine Lifestyle, featuring the best low histamine supplements and low histamine diet (The Histamine Intolerance Series)</h2><p><strong></strong><p><strong>You don't have any energy, you have unexplained symptoms, you feel low, and yet your doctor can't actually find anything 'wrong with you'.

She is also the author and illustrator of many picture books, including <em>Island Baby</em> and <em>Horace</em>.</p><p>Ms. Keller lives in West Redding, Connecticut.</p>Keller (Cecil's Garden) introduces a caterpillar and gosling in a deceptively simple story of friendship and transformation. They meet in a rain shower one day: " `Hey,' said a little voice./ `You're eating my umbrella," says feathered Marcel as Farfallina (whose name means "little butterfly" in Italian) nibbles on a leaf over his head. With a minimum of text, Keller describes the charming friendship's beginnings. When they play hide-and-seek, Farfallina hides under a low fern "because she knew that Marcel couldn't climb." In turn, Marcel hides behind a nearby tree "because he knew that Farfallina moved slowly." A full-page full-bleed painting shows Farfallina riding on the gosling's back across a lily-pad-dotted pond. One day, the caterpillar announces that she needs to climb onto a tree branch and rest for a while, and her patient pal settles in the grass to wait for her. A series of paintings follows each friend's metamorphosis Marcel's change in plumage, Farfallina's emergence from her cocoon. Finally reunited, neither creature recognizes the other and again bond as friends nonetheless. When they realize each other's true identities, Keller conveys their joy with the pair's fluttering of wings, and their quiet repose in an eloquently serene spread as they fall asleep "smiling at the stars." Keller's ending remains true to both nature and friendship that lasts through the seasons in this perfectly paced book.

Out of her hunger for a mother God, she has made food for us all. Out of her losses, she has made milk. It's what women's bodies know how to do, of course. But Rachel, oh honey, few of us do it so openly, so truthfully, so plainly, so well. Come, come, everyone&#x2014;Mormon or not, brothers, sisters, kindred&#x2014;and take these words. I am so proud that this book will teach the world what Mormon women know&#x2014;perhaps uniquely&#x2014;about God."&#x2014;Joanna Brooks, author of <i>Book of Mormon Girl.</i></p></p><p></p><h2>Think Like Jesus: 40 Days To Creating A Miracle Mindset</h2><p><p>As a Christian, we have all been called to do the works of Jesus, but in order to do the works of Jesus, we must have the mind of Jesus.

She knows because she's one of them. <br> <br> Terrie had made it: she had launched her own public relations company with such clients as Eddie Murphy and Johnnie Cochran. Yet she was in constant pain, waking up in terror, overeating in search of relief. For thirty years she kept on her game face of success, exhausting herself daily to satisfy her clients' needs while neglecting her own. <br> <br> Terrie finally collapsed, staying in bed for days. She had no clue what was wrong or if there was a way out. She had hit rock bottom and she needed and got help. <br> <br> She learned her problem had a name -- depression -- and that many suffered from it, limping through their days, hiding their hurt. As she healed, her mission became clear: break the silence of this crippling taboo and help those who suffer. <br> <br> <i>Black Pain</i> identifies emotional pain -- which uniquely and profoundly affects the Black experience -- as the root of lashing out through desperate acts of crime, violence, drug and alcohol abuse, eating disorders, workaholism, and addiction to shopping, gambling, and sex. Few realize these destructive acts are symptoms of our inner sorrow. <br> <br> Black people are dying. Everywhere we turn, in the faces we see and the headlines we read, we feel in our gut that something is wrong, but we don't know what it is. It's time to recognize it and work through our trauma. <br> <br> In <i>Black Pain</i>, Terrie has inspired the famous and the ordinary to speak out and mental health professionals to offer solutions. The book is a mirror turned on you. Do you see yourself and your loved ones here? Do the descriptions of how the pain looks, feels, and sounds seem far too familiar? Now you can do something about it. <br> <br> Stop suffering. The help the community needs is here: a clear explanation of our troubles and a guide to finding relief through faith, therapy, diet, and exercise, as well as through building a supportive network (and eliminating toxic people). <br> <br> <i>Black Pain</i> encourages us to face the truth about the issue that plunges our spirits into darkness, so that we can step into the healing light. <br> <br> You are not on the ledge alone.</p><p><i>Chapter One</i> <p> <b>Depression</b> </p><p> Not Killing Us Softly </p><p> <b>I'm Coming Out, I Want the World to Know It's not just what we say, but what we don't say...</b> </p><p> In June 2005 I wrote an article about my depression for <i>Essence</i> magazine. I was not prepared for the reaction it generated. I received over 10,000 letters, over half of them from people "coming out" for the first time about their pain and depression. Complete strangers wrote to me because I was the safest person they could share with. Not friends, not family members, but me -- someone they didn't know! I also wasn't prepared for the intensity of my frustration as I came to understand how many Black women and men are suffering silently. </p><p> The folks who wrote to me were scared -- some of them terrified -- to breathe a word to anyone; they were paralyzed by the fear that no one would understand or accept them. Their fear was echoed in conversation upon conversation I had while traveling across the country giving talks about how we are doing -- about waking up in pain each day -- to audiences that ranged from CEOs to regular churchgoers. After my talks, person after person would come to me to confide that they, too, were "going through it." </p><p> Sometimes I would come home from these trips totally drained in my heart and soul, having heard stories like the one I heard from a man whose two sisters are home suffering from major depression. He can't talk about it, nor can his family, even though he's a respected physician and his brother is a well-regarded man of the cloth! </p><p> If I'm honest with myself, and with you, the fact is that I'm more like these folks than I care to admit. If then <i>Essence</i> editor in chief Diane Weathers hadn't sensed what I was going through and asked me to write the piece, I don't know how much longer it would have taken before I really told someone I was depressed -- or if I would ever have told anyone before the point where there was no hiding it anymore. </p><p> In fact, my mom, dad, and sister didn't know what I was going through until I mailed them a draft of the article and wrote a kind of offhand note saying, "I wanted you to see this before it came out." I didn't even ask for their responses! </p><p> My mom called immediately. "I'm so sad you didn't feel like you could come to me. Maybe there was something I could have done!" And my sister told me that she, too, had been through the fire. But I was so used to handling things on my own that I believed telling them would only make them worry. I knew I wasn't suicidal, even though I <i>was</i> dying on the inside. The pain I feel is so hard to talk about that my closest family still hears more about it when I'm in front of large groups than one-on-one. </p><p> These days I use my visibility to talk about pain and how we mask it. Every time I step up to the microphone I "out" myself as someone in pain. I do it because I know that by sharing my story, my fragility, insecurity, frailty, and woundedness, I liberate someone else to do the same. </p><p> Sometimes the liberation comes through humor. In the months after the <i>Essence</i> piece came out, people would see me at events and shyly come over to me. I knew they wanted to mention the article and talk about depression, but didn't know how, so I would break the ice. "I can tell you read the <i>Essence</i> article," I would say. "Don't worry. I took my medication today. Everything's okay -- and you don't have to whisper the word 'depression'!" That little bit of humor, that easy laugh, was usually all it took to open the gates to honest talk about something we think is shameful. And I'm telling you, there is not one among us who has not been touched by this! </p><p> This book is as much about identifying depression as it is about the power of testimony. Some of the people whose stories are in this book were willing to bare their souls for the record, in the name of a cause bigger than themselves -- and that includes some of the most well-known names here. Others were willing and even eager to share their stories, but feared that giving their names could jeopardize their livelihoods or hurt their families, especially their young children; these are not famous people and I have respected their requests for anonymity because I believe their stories are the most valuable thing they have to offer. Finally, I have drawn on magazine and television interviews from a handful of famous people who have spoken publicly about their struggles with depression. </p><p> More important than anything else is that the thousands of people who have communicated with me about this in person, in writing, or on the phone have broken the silence that makes depression so lethal. In the passages below Set Shakur, Mama DeBarge, Joyce Walker Joseph, and Diane Weathers come out to me about their depression. </p><p> <b>Testimony</b> </p><p> If you ever danced or sang along to the infectious music of the DeBarge family, you can thank Etterlene "Mama" DeBarge for bringing all those gifted artists into our world. Sadly, her marriage to their father was nothing like the sweet music her children made. A jealous, controlling man, he kept "Mama" pregnant for most of fifteen years -- pregnant, lonely, and depressed. She shared with me a chilling excerpt from her forthcoming memoir: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> I lived every day in my own personal hell. I had noticed myself becoming more reclusive and despondent, and I spent every waking moment paranoid and afraid. I very rarely had visitors, and at one point I had even stopped answering the phone. The telephone was a luxury that I had learned to do without after my husband accused me of "talking to another man on the phone." It was actually a wrong number, and I had made the mistake of answering. It's a funny thing, depression; it's the only intangible thing I know of that can actually cause very real, very tangible changes in a person. The burden and the pain of my life weighed me down like a wet woolen blanket. I willed myself through every day by repeating to myself over and over again, <i>I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me</i>, and I would make it at least one more day. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> "Mama" made it through many days, and helped bring her children to realize their gifts and share them, but how much richer would all their lives have been if only she had been able to get the help she needed when she needed it most? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Charles J. Ogletree, Jr., is the Jesse Climenko Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, as well as the founder and executive director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice. This is what he told me about powerful Black men and depression: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> African-American leaders in particular face tremendous obstacles rising to the top, and even greater challenges staying there. We are the face of the struggle and are expected to always show strength, grit, determination, and confidence, when the burden of depression is doing everything it can to pull us back down. It is time that we all talk about our depression, and fight with the same vigor we bring to the fight for racial justice. We must reveal the darker moments and show, despite the pain that tries to bring us down, we realize that seeking treatment, talking through our pain, and taking the mask off our helplessness will not only make us stronger, but will allow others to appreciate the fact that depression touches us all. But we can fight back, and we can win. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> His words were much on my mind as I talked with two other powerful Black men, Carl Anthony Foreman and Bill Lynch, about their own pain. </p><p> Carl Anthony Foreman, the sixty-two-year-old powerhouse real estate mogul and owner of radio properties, was diagnosed only four years ago as suffering from bipolar disorder. For most of his life he experienced mood swings, at times feeling like he could conquer the world and buying up tons of property. At other times he felt bone weary, unable to talk, staying in bed in a darkened room for two to three days at a time. </p><p> Despite the range of his achievements his depression led him to move away from his wife and three sons when his youngest was fifteen years old. Although he supported them and lived nearby, when he sent the family on vacation, he couldn't go with them. </p><p> In some ways Carl's resources buffered him because he didn't have to go to a regular "job" every day. He would call his office at 3:00 a.m. "so I wouldn't have to talk to anyone." Then he'd leave a message that he wouldn't be in the office for a day or two so nobody would call and he could stay home alone, in silence. He wouldn't answer his phone. He would respond to voice mails in the middle of the night so he didn't have to talk to people. This strategy also gave him the advantages of surprise and respect, since people assumed he was working 24/7. </p><p> For a while he tried Zoloft and Lexapro, but they had side effects that, for him, were worse than the symptoms. "Chemical imbalance in our brains is no different than any other affliction we might have in our bodies. It's just that when it happens to the brain, it affects how you act and how you communicate." </p><p> Diagnosis late in life was a blessing and now Carl manages his depression by putting less stress on himself and not overworking. He attends fewer events, not stretching himself so thin, and does much of his business by phone. He also calls his therapist when he starts to feel overwhelmed. He's been coming out about his depression person by person, and each time he does, it's a little more liberating. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Sekyiwa (Set) Shakur is a thirty-one-year-old high-powered fashion designer and sister of the late Tupac Shakur. She's a warm and open spirit, someone who is clear about who she is and who she's becoming. She's also a woman who uses her own pain and challenges to help others. At twenty-three she began mentoring girls at the YWCA, because she feels it's important for young people to "hear us speak our truth, so that they know healing is possible." </p><p> She remembers always being uncomfortable in her own skin.

What we experience in our daily lives often feels like anything but heaven. But what if we understood how powerful we are&#x2014;that we are powerful enough to mold both our internal and our external reality?Anita Moorjani, the New York Times bestselling author of Dying to Be Me, is convinced we can do exactly that. The process, she explains, requires dismantling many cultural myths mistaken for indisputable truths. Beliefs such as "We get what we deserve," "Loving ourselves is selfish," and "Coincidences are just that&#x2014;coincidences," are ingrained within us from birth, pervasive and influential, leading to generations of misguidance. Following her near-death experience, Moorjani began to embody truths she learned in the other realm, discovering that letting go of these outmoded myths allowed her to experience heaven not as a physical place but as a state of mind, right here and right now. In this examination of our common myths, she shares stories and examples from her own life, revealing the lies beneath the surface of what she was taught and absorbed. By freeing ourselves from these falsehoods, Moorjani asserts, we can leave fear, heartache, and self-imposed boundaries behind and instead live lives full of purpose and joy.</p><p>Several of you have written to me saying "How can this possibly be heaven? If this is heaven, why does it feel like hell??" And I want to say that I'm actually not surprised by that reaction, and even when I came up with the title, I expected some of you to say that to me!! So let me explain. <b>Many years ago, my life was hell too</b>. I was bullied very badly as a child, and was taunted and discriminated against for the color of my skin and my family origin--something I had no control over. That really made my life miserable. And it certainly felt like hell when I was going through cancer, being in constant pain and fear for all those years.<br> <br> Life truly was a struggle for me, and I lived in immense fear for a huge part of my life. I had always believed that life happens to us. In other words, I believed that I was a victim of my circumstances, so I was always reacting to life instead of creating life. Of course I didn't believe I created my life circumstances. Who would create a childhood of bullying and discrimination, all of which shaped my thinking? Who would choose to be born as a woman into a culture that still believes women are inferior to men? Who would create cancer in their own life? Of course I was a victim of my circumstances. Or so I thought...until I "died".<br> <br>It's been 10 years since I faced death and came out the other side. Now when I look back at these past 10 years, I can see that my life is so drastically different from what it was prior, that I sometimes wonder whether I actually came back from death, or whether I'm still in the other realm. All the fear I used to have, all the pain, all the insecurity - they are all gone! So much so that I wonder whether I'm still dead and this is heaven! Every day, I get to do stuff I love to do! Of course this feels like heaven!<br> <br> But then I read the letters I have received over the last few years from so many of you, where you share your pain, and your fears. And also, I take a look around at the world around us. And it all brings me back down to earth. And I wonder, "Why can't we all create this state of heaven for ourselves? What is preventing us from doing it? Why did it take death for me to realize how to live my life? Isn't it a wasted life if people only learn the truth of how to live when they die?"<br> <br> Those are the questions that inspired me to write this book.<b> I don't want you to have to wait until you die to learn how to live. Remember, we are all connected, and I feel what you feel. This book comes from my heart to yours.</b><br> <br> Much Love,<br> <br> AnitaAnita Moorjani is the New York Times best-selling author of Dying to Be Me (published by Hay House in 2012), an account of her nearly four-year battle with cancer that culminated in a fascinating and moving near-death experience in 2006, which vastly changed her perspective on life.

This special edition contains full-bleed images and a booklet that reveals every secret hidden in the cards.</p> <p>The companion booklets for most Lo Scarabeo decks are in five languages: English, Spanish, French, Italian, and German.</p></p><p><p>Lo Scarabeo's Tarot decks have been acclaimed all over the world for originality and quality. With the best Italian and international artists, each Lo Scarabeo deck is an exceptional artistic value.</p> <p>Commited to developing innovative new decks while preserving the rich tradition of Tarot, Lo Scarabeo continues to be a favorite among collectors and readers.</p> <p>Llewellyn is the exclusive distributor of Lo Scarabeo products in North America.</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br> This deck, done in the style of Mucha, features images that are beautiful and filled with energy and emotion. Following the Rider Waite Smith standard, the deck is readable out of the box. Packaged in a lovely box with a meaty little booklet, this deck will find its way into the hands of many readers.</p> <p><strong>Full Review:</strong><br> The end of the 19th century was characterized by an optimism that led to the name "Belle Epoque." In this environment, the Art Nouveau movement was born. Its philosophy: that everything made by human hands could (and should) become an art form. While Alphonse Mucha never called himself an Art Nouveau artist, he spent his life living that philosophy. He infused all his work through many mediums&#x2015;sculptures, stained glass, jewelry, and his famous theatre posters&#x2015;with beauty. Instead of creating what they thought of as "slavish depictions of reality," these artists, Mucha included, sought to express emotion, essence, and mystery. This tendency makes this art form a perfect partner for tarot, which may be why the <em>Art Nouveau Tarot</em> is so popular.</p> <p>What really sets this deck apart from other "in the style of" decks is that it follows the traditional Rider Waite Smith style, so it is easily recognizable and easy to read with out of the box. However, in the spirit of Art Nouveau, the compositions and images are not slavish. Changes in the perspective and composition variations give the images a new vitality while still remaining identifiable.</p> <p>Some Art Nouveau, to me, seems flat and lifeless. Nice designs and aesthetically pleasing with beautiful flowing lines, but somehow still lifeless. These images keep Mucha's basic style but the images have more life, more movement. They are more evocative and emotional, with fewer esoteric and Christian symbols, than the Rider Waite Smith deck, but they retain the essential energy of the cards.</p> <p>The booklet is larger than usual for Lo Scarabeo decks and the packaging is wonderful...a sturdy cardboard box that snuggly fits the cards and booklet and has a removable top. The booklet is very good and helpful and includes three spreads inspired by Mucha's art. There are also sample readings, which is usually unheard of in booklets. In fact, it is more like a tiny book than a booklet.</p> <p>I brought this deck to a conference and everyone who saw it, loved it. I've been using it for readings and for classes and it has been a joy in every instance.

It is going to be the <i>best</i> Christmas ever! After a snowy expedition to pick out the perfect tree, it&#x2019;s time to decorate. But whenever Maple gets near the tree, she starts sniffling and sneezing. Could she really be allergic to the perfect Christmas tree? And if so, how will the girls find a way to make this the best Christmas after all?</p><p><b>Lori Nichols </b>(www.lorinichols.com) spent her childhood in northwestern Pennsylvania, surrounded by maple trees. As she grew, so did her appreciation of trees and nature. Her books about nature-loving sisters Maple and Willow spring from this love, and the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> called them &#x201c;utterly charming.&#x201d; Lori now lives in Birmingham, Alabama, with her husband and three free-spirited daughters. Many days you can find Lori and her family under their maple tree, swinging in hammocks, playing kickball or just being loud.&#x201c;The understated humor, spare language, and white backgrounds convey a calm, minimalist world in which Christmas isn't overwhelming and sisters always work out their differences. Endearing illustrations . . . show the two round-headed, light-skinned little girls enjoying their time together, from sledding to baking to building an unusual snowman. . . . A charming addition to a winning series.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;As in previous books, Nichols admirably captures the sisterly bond, often without words. The ink-and-watercolor artwork is full of real-life emotions. . . .

"Let the first annual Wand What You Want hour begin!"</p> <p>Wands begin popping up in kids' hands as we walk through the halls, and we all cheer. Pop! My wand arrives in my hand-long, dark gray, and nicked like it's seen a few battles. Hmm...what to try first... I'm just about to test the wand out when I feel the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Instinct tells me to dive out of the way. When I look up, I see a classmate spelling the troll next to her. The girl turns into an ice sculpture. Geez, that was close. I better stay alert.</p> <p>Pop! Pop! Pop! Kids begin casting all around me. The crowded hallway is suddenly full of talking woodland creatures, toads, fireworks, and a pretty impressive cloud raining licorice. Kids are cheering and fighting, and the sound of all those wands working is enough to give me a headache. I hurry away from the spell zapping, looking for somewhere to practice alone.</p> <p>Slurp!</p> <p>The chaotic hallway disappears behind me, and a new empty hall arrives in its place. I happen to know this hall leads to the school courtyard so I hurry down it and head outside. Ahhh...this is more like it. The warm sun is shining bright high above the castle walls, making me wistful for adventure. I can never sit still for long.</p> <p>"Pardon the interruption! We hope you are enjoying your wand experience, but remember, all wands disappear at the hour mark so choose your magic wisely," Miri says. I'm relieved to find no mirror in the courtyard, which means she can't see what I'm up to. That magic mirror is forever tattling on students for bad behavior. "As a reminder, flying is not advised."</p> <p>"Not advised, but she didn't say it was against the rules," I say to myself. I flick the wand over my stuffy, uncomfortable pale-blue uniform and turn it into a comfy peasant shirt and pants. I swap out my ugly school shoes for my beloved lace-up boots. Now that I'm comfortable, I get to the task at hand. I'm sure an actual spell would work better, but since I don't know one, I just imagine myself flying and-bam! I'm slowly floating up, up, up in the air. Score!</p> <p>A Pegasus flies by me pulling a coach with four students in it.</p> <p>"Hi, Gilly!" they shout and wave.</p> <p>When you save your school from a wicked fairy, people tend to remember your name. Even if you don't remember theirs.</p> <p>"Hi!" I say, lying back like I'm floating on a cloud. Wow, this is relaxing. I stretch my arms wide and-oops!</p> <p>My wand falls from my grasp. Uh-oh. I begin to plummet, spinning faster and faster with no sign of stopping. Before I can even think of a way to break my fall, whoosh! I feel my body hit a blanket and bounce up, then land again on a magic carpet.</p> <p>"Ten minutes into Wand What You Want, and you're already having a near-death experience?" my friend Jax asks. His curly blond hair looks white in the bright sunlight. He casually waves his own wand in my direction with a glint in his violet eyes. "You're getting sloppy."</p> <p>"I'm not getting sloppy!" I'm seriously offended by that statement. "How'd you even know where to find me?"</p> <p>"I thought to myself, &#x2018;What would Gilly do with wand access for an hour?' and I knew right away you'd try to sneak home for a bit," Jax says. "Let's give it a go, shall we?"</p> <p>My usual partner in crime steers our magic carpet over the castle walls and across the vast school grounds. Below I can see students fanned out on castle rooftops, in the garden mazes, and near the lake, all casting away with various results. Jax flies the carpet faster, the wind whipping our hair and making it hard to see. I push the hair away from my eyes and strain to see home.</p> <p>There beyond the silver turrets of Royal Manor, where the princesses who rule our kingdom live, is my small village of Enchantasia. Somewhere down there, my family is working, playing, and hopefully missing me as much as I miss them. The carpet is nearing the Hollow Woods-which separates us and the village-and I lean forward. It's going to happen. We're going to leave school and see them! Closer we fly to the treetops...closer to the forest filled with ogres...closer to leaving school grounds when-CRACKLE!</p> <p>Our magic carpet is suddenly stunned by an invisible wall that keeps us from escaping the school grounds. A magical scroll drops from the sky into our laps. "Leaving school grounds is forbidden!" it says in sparkling script that glows red like a warning. "Please return to the castle at once!" It's signed "Headmistress Flora."</p> <p>"Smooth, Flora," Jax says. "Putting a barricade in the sky during wand training was clever."</p> <p>"Leaving was a long shot, but maybe I could wave my wand and at least see what my family is up to," I say and gasp. "My wand! I need to go get it."</p> <p>"Lose something, Gilly?" Our friend Maxine pilots a small flying swan boat I recognize from the Mother Goose carnival that was at school this past weekend. How does Maxine have one of those boats? Hmm... Bigger question: What's she doing in midair? Ogres don't usually like to be off the ground.</p> <p>Maxine's right eye spins in its socket as she makes her way toward us with a crooked smile. Her thick neck is covered in layers of necklaces and the jewels she used to like to steal. (That's how she got thrown in FTRS. My offense was pickpocketing and shoplifting.) Maxine tosses the wand toward me but it's snatched away.</p> <p>"Come and get it!" Jax's roommate, Ollie, shouts. He's flying on the back of a black baby dragon, which does not seem smart. Ollie dives back toward the courtyard and Jax, Maxine, and I follow, landing seconds later in the courtyard I left only minutes before. I jump off the carpet and grab my wand from Ollie before his baby dragon can eat it. But I don't need to worry because-poof!-the dragon disappears.</p> <p>"A baby dragon on school grounds?" My roommate, Kayla, waves her wand in the air dangerously, and I worry about what she could zap next. Her wings pop out of her back and she flutters to Ollie's side. As a fairy, Kayla can shrink to the size of a teacup, but at the moment, she towers over Ollie, white-blond hair whipping in the wind. "That thing could burn down the whole school."</p> <p>"We've already had that almost happen," Jax jokes. "Let's not do it again."</p> <p>"Fine," Ollie says dejectedly. "I really wanted a pet." His eyes light up. "Snack break!" He waves his wand at the ground and conjures up an apple pie as big as the magic carpet I was just on. Poof! He also creates a supersize ice cream sundae and a plate of cookies as big as Maxine. He waves the wand again and a picnic basket, blanket, and plates appear on the grass beside it. "Let's eat!"</p> <p>"We could use some ambiance," says Kayla who quickly transforms a dead rosebush into a beautiful plant with eye-popping roses in shades of fuchsia, electric blue, and lime green. Kayla flutters over to the blanket to help Ollie dish out dessert. He's using his wand as a cake knife and slicing pieces as big as my arm.</p> <p>"Don't forget the music," says Maxine. She waves her wand in the air, and a flock of birds appears on a tree above us. They begin to chirp and hum in harmony. "Yes! It worked!" Maxine trudges over to the blanket happily, her ogre feet leaving deep footprints in the grass.</p> <p>"Flora must have lost her mind to let a bunch of reform-school kids use wands for an hour," Jax says, flashing me a smile so blinding that I wish I had shades.</p> <p>Poof! I use my wand to conjure up a pair. Sweet! I wish we could use wands every day instead of just in How a Wand Works 101. Madame Camille, our uptight fairy teacher, never lets us sign them out for homework, and every time someone screws up by zapping off their pinkie or growing their nose to three times its size, she says, "This is why Enchantasia doesn't allow wands 'til you're twenty-one!"</p> <p>If I'd had a wand when I lived in the village, I wouldn't have had to steal food to help feed my brothers and sisters in our overcrowded boot. I could have just conjured up the finest treats Gnome-olia Bakery had to offer with a flick of my wrist. Then I wouldn't have been sentenced to Fairy Tale Reform School. From the outside, this place looks like your average school. But inside we have hallways that move every time you use them, a talking magic mirror who tattles on you if you step out of line, a class taught by a mer-teacher inside a giant fish tank, and professors who all are former villains. How do you like them poison apples?</p> <p>FTRS is nothing like that snooze-fest shoemaker trade school I used to attend and will have to go back to when I prove I have transformed my villainous ways into upstanding ones. Some days-when villains aren't trying to kill me-I'm bummed about being sprung from this joint. Especially when I think about leaving this crew.</p> <p>"Look, I get Flora disappearing to help Professor Wolfington suppress his wolf side again, but where has she been since he came back?" Jax continues. "We never see her around school, and now she's letting us take wands out for a spin? Something's up."</p> <p>"I'm with Jax," Maxine says, apple oozing down her chin as she chews. "My mini magical scroll has been showing me weird messages like &#x2018;She'll reappear when you're all distracted' instead of articles from Happily Ever After Scrolls."</p> <p>Ollie gives me a look. Maxine swears her mini magical scroll is sending her messages, but mini magical scrolls only report the daily Enchantasia news. She seems to think her scroll is magical. Okay, more magical.</p> <p>"Yesterday it said, &#x2018;Prepare. She is coming soon.'" Maxine cuts another slice of pie for herself that is as big as her head. "Who is coming? Flora? I quickly hid my scroll since I was supposed to be doing homework."</p> <p>"I think Flora is just trying to give us some freedom," I say. "If they don't give us freedom every now and then, how are they going to see whether we're reforming?"</p> <p>"Yeah, Maxine. Can't you just be happy we have an afternoon off from Villain to Hero: How to Make the Switch?" Kayla asks.</p> <p>Maxine frowns. "I actually kind of miss Dragon Slaying 101, but sometimes learning about a dragon's weak spots is enough to make me want to breathe fire."</p> <p>I sit up. "That gives me an idea." I begin to aim my wand but Jax stops me.</p> <p>"I'm serious, guys," Jax says quietly. "Alva's on the loose, someone is spilling royal secrets, and Flora keeps disappearing. Don't you want to know what's going on?"</p> <p>Jax is an undercover royal at a reform school. Of course he wants to sort things out and go back to being all royally. (He is secretly Rapunzel's brother, not that she knows that. She thinks he's off at boarding school, and Jax's dad had the royal court's memories bewitched so no one recognizes him.) And yes, I want to go home to my family, but in the past two months I've saved royals, kept our school from burning down, and had T-shirts made with my name on them. I need a short recess to relax.</p> <p>"Can't we take an hour off from being good guys and enjoy doing something a bit wicked?" I conjure up Jax's favorite pie-figgy pudding-and his eyes go wide. "Let's eat before we plot!"</p> <p>My friends and I begin slicing up the desserts in front of us when poof! They disappear right in front of our eyes.</p> <p>"Hey!" Ollie's fork hangs in the air over a now-empty plate. "Who did that?"</p> <p>I look around the courtyard. Through the stained glass windows inside the school, I can see flashes of light every time a wand is used. Some hallways are filled with water where mermaids swim with ease and students have transformed into sharks and octopuses. Other windows show students dressed like princesses and pirates, while another set of windows shows mischief that could get those kids detention for a week with Madame Cleo. But I couldn't see a single person pointing a wand our way.</p> <p>Then I hear a sinister laugh. I exhale sharply and look closer at my surroundings. I point my wand directly at the black gargoyle statue near the courtyard door that I don't remember seeing earlier. The statue starts to spark and then it transforms into a girl with long, dark hair in a black dress covered with stars and moons.</p> <p>"Ouch! That hurt!" Jocelyn rubs her butt, which has a burn mark on one of the half-moons. "You singed my dress!"</p> <p>"You stole our dessert." I wave my wand, wondering what I could do to Jocelyn next. Turn her into a toad? Make her wear a pink princess dress since she's allergic to any color but black? Lock her in a tower to keep her from casting any more spells?</p> <p>"Sorry for the interruption, students," Miri's voice is back over the magical loudspeaker system. "Headmistress Flora would like me to remind you that illegal use of magic-such as escape attempts, turning your roommate into a toad, or using wand work for monetary gain-is not allowed. Today's Wand What You Want experiment is to see how you handle having a bit of wand freedom. Remember that. Thank you!"</p> <p>Fiddlesticks.</p> <p>"Did you want to join us?" Maxine asks awkwardly. She may be slightly afraid of the Evil Queen's little sister, but I'm not. Professor Harlow is now tucked away in the FTRS dungeons. Why Headmistress Flora allowed Jocelyn to stay in school is beyond me.</p> <p>"She's not welcome here," I say calmly. "Give our food back."</p> <p>Jocelyn shrugs. "Make me."</p> <p>I use my wand to make the food reappear.</p> <p>Jocelyn zaps it and makes it disappear.</p> <p>I bring the food back.</p> <p>Jocelyn makes it vanish.</p> <p>Appear, disappear, appear, disappear.</p> <p>Finally I snap. With my wand high above my head, I lift Ollie's giant apple pie and let the whole thing drop on Jocelyn's head. She screams. "Score!" I shout.</p> <p>"Gilly, don't start with her," Kayla says, growing nervous. She's still a bit jittery around villains. I can't say I blame her. She was blackmailed by Alva for years, forced to help the evil fairy in exchange for information on the whereabouts of her missing family. (Who are now trees. It's complicated.)</p> <p>"I'm fine!" I say, but while I'm laughing, Jocelyn is conjuring. Smack! A piece of pudding pie flies into my face.</p> <p>"How does the pudding taste, Cobbler?" Jocelyn taunts. "I bet you guys could never afford pudding in your boot."</p> <p>"We can now, while you're an orphan with an evil sister in lockup." I shoot a cherry pie at her face. It explodes and covers her with cherries. Hee. I look to Kayla for approval, but that "orphan" comment leaves her cold. Okay, maybe that was a bit harsh. I'm so busy staring at Kayla that I don't feel the crackle 'til it's too late.</p> <p>"My hair!" I screech as my head begins to glow for a second, then stops. I feel my hair. It's all still there. I exhale. "Ha! Your spell didn't work!" I sing out.</p> <p>"Um, Gilly?" Ollie asks. "Did you always have a purple streak in your hair?"</p> <p>I pull the front of my hair forward and gasp. A deep purple stripe is now running through my long, brown hair. Jocelyn bursts out laughing.</p> <p>"Change it back!"</p> <p>Jocelyn shrugs. "Can't. I didn't spell you. I cursed you. It can't be undone."</p> <p>"Why you..." Zap! I send a vat of chocolate ice cream raining down on her head.</p> <p>"Enough!" Ollie says as a wall of dead fish smacks him in the face, leaving a slimy trail on his light-brown skin.</p> <p>"You can't do that." Jax sounds funny holding his nose. He quickly conjures up a massive bowl of cooked spinach, which hits Jocelyn with a loud splat.</p> <p>Soon food is flying through the air like hail. Broccoli is raining from the rooftop. Mashed potatoes create walls we can use as barricades. Radishes hit Kayla in the head and give her welts. We're so busy conjuring up food that we don't hear the sound at first.</p></p><h2>7 Pillars of Freedom Workbook</h2><p><p>The 7 Pillars workbook is a 10 month, weekly study designed to bring healing and freedom from unwanted and destructive sexual behaviors.

From the violent jungles of the Vietnam war to the hand to hand combat of getting free from sexual bondage, to pastoring and speaking before thousands, Dr. Roberts knows what it takes to conquer hell at close range. He brings not only a theological depth, but clinical expertise to the battle that has resulted in tens of thousands of men getting free and finding real hope in the grace of Christ. Pure Desire Ministries International began in the local church, as Dr. Ted and Diane Roberts, the founders, recognized the pervasiveness of sexual struggle in the church. The pat answers of the past only gave men and women a message of &#34;try harder&#34; which kept them isolated in their sin and shame. Over the course of two decades, they developed a strategy that is Biblically-based, clinically informed, and highly successful at creating lasting change. In 2007, Pure Desire became an independent 501c3 aimed at helping the church body across the country and around the world. In 2014, the award-winning video series, The Conquer Series began to put the message and principles of Pure Desire in front of more and more churches. This video series serves as an on-ramp for people in the church to understand the true nature of sexual addiction, and to seek healing in a grace-filled, redemptive way.</p><h2>Go, Train, Go!

Three eternal questions can help us into our power and use it judiciously:</p><ul><li>Who am I?</li><li>What is real?</li><li>How do I express love?</li></ul><p>At each stage in our lives, we must ask these simple yet deeply profound questions.

One by one, doughnuts were chosen, placed in paper bags, and whisked away with their new owners. Some went by the dozen in giant boxes.</i><br><i>"Good-bye!" Arnie yelled to each doughnut. "Have a good trip!"</i><br><i>"This is so exciting!" Arnie beamed. "I wonder who will choose ME?"</i></p><p>At first glance, Arnie looks like an average doughnut&#x2015;round, cakey, with a hole in the middle, iced and sprinkled. He was made by one of the best bakeries in town, and admittedly his sprinkles are candy-colored. Still, a doughnut is just a doughnut, right?</p><p>WRONG! Not if Arnie has anything to say about it. And, for a doughnut, he sure seems to have an awful lot to say. Can Arnie change the fate of all doughnuts&#x2015;or at least have a hand in his own future?

Arnie is proud to be chocolate-covered, with bright-colored candy sprinkles. His first day on the planet is a big one. He is 1) cut into a ring 2) deep-fried 3) cooled 4) iced 5) sprinkled and 6) named Arnie. What he doesn't realize is that step 7 is being eaten by a human. So, when a customer, Mr. Bing, starts to put him in his mouth, he screams, "What are you doing?" Arnie is further crushed when he calls the bakery to warn the others only to discover that all the other pastries are "aware of this arrangement." Unfortunately, this delightful plot twist is soured by the contrived ones that follow. Mr. Bing decides that in order to get his money's worth from Arnie he can pretend the doughnut is the dog he's always wanted--a doughnut-dog that will roll over, play fetch, etc.: "He went through a short phase of chewing on the furniture and barking at the mailman, but after a crash course in obedience school he graduated first in his class." However half-baked the story turns out to be, the funny asides and captions that Keller sprinkles throughout the book are often brilliant and the busy, crazy paintings are lots of fun, too.

He and his wife had 11 children. He was a lawyer and many people came to him for advice. But whenever he had a moment, he would jot down a line of poetry. He <i>loved</i> writing poems. When the War of 1812 broke out, Francis became even busier. He was well-respected and often called upon to help keep the peace as the war between the United States and England raged on. One fateful night Francis and his friend helped talk the British Navy into releasing a prisoner of war. But they couldn't return home just yet because the Battle of Fort McHenry was starting! If the British captured the fort, America might very well lose its independence. Francis and his friends could only sit on a boat and observe the battle. For 25 hours they watched in awe. What Francis saw inspired him to write a poem that would become America's national anthem! This Step 3 reader is perfect&nbsp; for children who are ready to read independently.</p></p><p>MONICA KULLING has published many books for children including picture books, poetry, and biographies including a number of Step into Reading titles.Details about the writing of our national anthem could be a lot for beginning readers to handle, but this entry in the Step into Reading series manages to include quite a bit without overwhelming or oversimplifying. Much of the text is about the War of 1812, but readers will also learn details about Francis Scott Key and what led him to write his famous work. Colorful cartoon drawings showing a good amount of the action accompany text set in an appealing large and well-spaced type. As the purpose of this is to appeal to the beginning reader rather than to be used for research, children will have to look elsewhere for the lyrics or other additional information. There is a brief afterword with tidbits about the Fort McHenry flag and an accompanying photo. Many titles exist on this subject, but few are for this level of reader; however, Lynea Bowdish&#x2019;s Francis Scott Key and &#x201c;The Star-Spangled Banner&#x201d; (2002) would be a good pairing.

Before you can say paint-by-numbers, the two artists become fierce rivals, calling each other names and ultimately building a fence between them. But when the two painters paint opposite sides of the fence that divides them, they unknowingly create a modern art masterpiece, and learn it is their friendship that is the true work of art. <br>Nina Laden's wacky illustrations complement this funny story that non only introduces children to two of the world's most extraordinary modern artists, but teaches a very important lesson&#x2010;how to creatively resolve a conflictin a most unusual way.<br></p></p><p>Nina Laden grew up in the New York City area. The daughter of two artists, she studied illustration at Syracuse University. She is the author and illustrator of The Night I Followed the Dog, also published by Chronicle Books.Verbal and visual puns fill Laden's (The Night I Followed the Dog) sly homage to Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, who are keenly caricatured as a prima-donna pig and a feisty bull. Pigasso is a dark-eyed hog in a red beret; his facial features rearrange according to his mood, and bruisy hues of blue and purple shadow his yellow-pink complexion. His painting of female pigs?a crafty version of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon?causes an art-world sensation. A canvas by Mootisse, a sophisticated orange bull with a neat brown beard and red-framed spectacles, featuring five graceful, nude cows?The Dance with udders?is hailed as a "Moosterpiece." After urban success, Pigasso and Mootisse move into country homes on either side of an ochre-dirt road. Pigasso's landscape features a tart-yellow house, angular shrubbery and a sharp-edged apple tree bearing cut-open fruit. Mootisse's farm offers a curvy tree, a patchwork garden of cutout leaf-shapes, and a construction-paper-smooth lawn that complements the red house. The artists at first share baguettes and bottles of wine, and make gifts of their paintings, but their friendship erodes as they snipe at each other's styles. Laden lightly satirizes the duo as "pig-headed and bull-headed," respectively, then lets them admit grudging admiration. She cites cubist and fauvist philosophies (Pigasso calls his rival a "wild beast"), and she mimics the real painters' techniques, so that Pigasso favors hard black outlines and Mootisse prefers brilliant side-by-side shades. While junior art historians familiar with the artists' work will laugh loudest, an afterword offers novices the background for this well-observed comedy.

The next crisis then hits: What am I going to do about it? One solution is to use the support and experience of fellow addicts and alcoholics who have successfully recovered in 12 Step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous. Yet the traditional Steps and approved literature may prove problematic, for they have seen little evolution since their evangelical origins in the 1930s. This guide features adaptations grounded in a science-based understanding of both addiction and the recovery process. The best indicator of success is not how confidently we proclaim &#x201c;God will do this&#x201d; or &#x201c;I got this&#x201d;. The best indicator is the willingness to show up and actively work on recovery with a &#x201c;little help from my friends&#x201d;.</p><p>Anonymity is part of the Twelve Traditions by which Twelve Step groupsgovern themselves, and I wish to respect these and remain anonymous. Iam a biologist by training, and an agnostic by nature. I hold a PhD in a biomedically related field, and I have roughly two decades ofexperience in biological research and education. Currently, I teachadvanced biology courses; addiction biology is included in the topics Icover. Addiction has a complex pathology, and I admire the holistic, and very effective, approach provided by Twelve Step recovery."Bill W. delves into the biological processes of addiction and the universal characteristics of users, applying knowledge he has acquired as both a biologist and former alcoholic. In this section in particular, the author makes complex concepts incredibly clear by using tangible examples and metaphors. For example, he compares addiction to a furnace with a broken thermostat that will continue to heat up until there are disastrous consequences. The second half of the manual is focused solely on Bill W.'s plan, with steps broken down into "The First 90 Days Sober" (Steps 1 to3), "Reconstruction" (Steps 4 to 9), and "Long-Term Sobriety" (Steps 10 to 12). Having traversed the 12-step program himself, the author often uses the pronoun"we" with a tone free of judgment. His sharing of powerful firsthand experiences further personalizes and legitimizes his writing."

Years before, he had been an English major at Baltimore's Loyola College and had always dreamed of writing a novel. His first effort, <i>The Hunt for Red October</i>--the first of the phenomenally successful Jack Ryan novels--sold briskly as a result of rave reviews, then catapulted onto the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list after President Reagan pronounced it "the perfect yarn." From that day forward, Clancy established himself as an undisputed master at blending exceptional realism and authenticity, intricate plotting, and razor-sharp suspense. He passed away in October 2013.<p>THE FIRST DAY</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>FRIDAY, 3 DECEMBER</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Red October</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Captain First Rank Marko Ramius of the Soviet Navy was dressed for the Arctic conditions normal to the Northern Fleet submarine base at Polyarnyy. Five layers of wool and oilskin enclosed him. A dirty harbor tug pushed his submarine's bow around to the north, facing down the channel. The dock that had held his Red October for two interminable months was now a water-filled concrete box, one of the many specially built to shelter strategic missile submarines from the harsh elements. On its edge a collection of sailors and dockyard workers watched his ship sail in stolid Russian fashion, without a wave or a cheer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Engines ahead slow, Kamarov," he ordered. The tug slid out of the way, and Ramius glanced aft to see the water stirring from the force of the twin bronze propellers. The tug's commander waved. Ramius returned the gesture. The tug had done a simple job, but done it quickly and well. The Red October, a Typhoon-class sub, moved under her own power towards the main ship channel of the Kola Fjord.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"There's Purga, Captain." Gregoriy Kamarov pointed to the icebreaker that would escort them to sea. Ramius nodded. The two hours required to transit the channel would tax not his seamanship but his endurance. There was a cold north wind blowing, the only sort of north wind in this part of the world. Late autumn had been surprisingly mild, and scarcely any snow had fallen in an area that measures it in meters; then a week before a major winter storm had savaged the Murmansk coast, breaking pieces off the Arctic icepack. The icebreaker was no formality. The Purga would butt aside any ice that might have drifted overnight into the channel. It would not do at all for the Soviet Navy's newest missile submarine to be damaged by an errant chunk of frozen water.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The water in the fjord was choppy, driven by the brisk wind. It began to lap over the October's spherical bow, rolling back down the flat missile deck which lay before the towering black sail. The water was coated with the bilge oil of numberless ships, filth that would not evaporate in the low temperatures and that left a black ring on the rocky walls of the fjord as though from the bath of a slovenly giant. An altogether apt simile, Ramius thought. The Soviet giant cared little for the dirt it left on the face of the earth, he grumbled to himself. He had learned his seamanship as a boy on inshore fishing boats, and knew what it was to be in harmony with nature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Increase speed to one-third," he said. Kamarov repeated his captain's order over the bridge telephone. The water stirred more as the October moved astern of the Purga. Captain Lieutenant Kamarov was the ship's navigator, his last duty station having been harbor pilot for the large combatant vessels based on both sides of the wide inlet. The two officers kept a weather eye on the armed icebreaker three hundred meters ahead. The Purga's after deck had a handful of crewmen stomping about in the cold, one wearing the white apron of a ship's cook. They wanted to witness the Red October's first operational cruise, and besides, sailors will do almost anything to break the monotony of their duties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ordinarily it would have irritated Ramius to have his ship escorted out-the channel here was wide and deep-but not today. The ice was something to worry about. And so, for Ramius, was a great deal else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"So, my Captain, again we go to sea to serve and protect the Rodina!" Captain Second Rank Ivan Yurievich Putin poked his head through the hatch-without permission, as usual-and clambered up the ladder with the awkwardness of a landsman. The tiny control station was already crowded enough with the captain, the navigator, and a mute lookout. Putin was the ship's zampolit (political officer). Everything he did was to serve the Rodina (Motherland), a word that had mystical connotations to a Russian and, along with V. I. Lenin, was the Communist Party's substitute for a godhead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Indeed, Ivan," Ramius replied with more good cheer than he felt. "Two weeks at sea. It is good to leave the dock. A seaman belongs at sea, not tied alongside, overrun with bureaucrats and workmen with dirty boots. And we will be warm."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You find this cold?" Putin asked incredulously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the hundredth time Ramius told himself that Putin was the perfect political officer. His voice was always too loud, his humor too affected. He never allowed a person to forget what he was. The perfect political officer. Putin was an easy man to fear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I have been in submarines too long, my friend. I grow accustomed to moderate temperatures and a stable deck under my feet." Putin did not notice the veiled insult. He'd been assigned to submarines after his first tour on destroyers had been cut short by chronic seasickness-and perhaps because he did not resent the close confinement aboard submarines, something that many men cannot tolerate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ah, Marko Aleksandrovich, in Gorkiy on a day like this, flowers bloom!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"And what sort of flowers might those be, Comrade Political Officer?" Ramius surveyed the fjord through his binoculars. At noon the sun was barely over the southeast horizon, casting orange light and purple shadows along the rocky walls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Why, snow flowers, of course," Putin said, laughing loudly. "On a day like this the faces of the children and the women glow pink, your breath trails behind you like a cloud, and the vodka tastes especially fine. Ah, to be in Gorkiy on a day like this!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The bastard ought to work for Intourist, Ramius told himself, except that Gorkiy is a city closed to foreigners. He had been there twice. It had struck him as a typical Soviet city, full of ramshackle buildings, dirty streets, and ill-clad citizens. As it was in most Russian cities, winter was Gorkiy's best season. The snow hid all the dirt. Ramius, half Lithuanian, had childhood memories of a better place, a coastal village whose Hanseatic origin had left rows of presentable buildings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was unusual for anyone other than a Great Russian to be aboard-much less command-a Soviet naval vessel. Marko's father, Aleksandr Ramius, had been a hero of the Party, a dedicated, believing Communist who had served Stalin faithfully and well. When the Soviets first occupied Lithuania in 1940, the elder Ramius was instrumental in rounding up political dissidents, shop owners, priests, and anyone else who might have been troublesome to the new regime. All were shipped off to fates that now even Moscow could only guess at. When the Germans invaded a year later, Aleksandr fought heroically as a political commissar, and was later to distinguish himself in the Battle of Leningrad. In 1944 he returned to his native land with the spearhead of the Eleventh Guards Army to wreak bloody vengeance on those who had collaborated with the Germans or been suspected of such. Marko's father had been a true Soviet hero-and Marko was deeply ashamed to be his son. His mother's health had been broken during the endless siege of Leningrad. She died giving birth to him, and he was raised by his paternal grandmother in Lithuania while his father strutted through the Party Central Committee in Vilnius, awaiting his promotion to Moscow. He got that, too, and was a candidate member of the Politburo when his life was cut short by a heart attack.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Marko's shame was not total. His father's prominence had made his current goal a possibility, and Marko planned to wreak his own vengeance on the Soviet Union, enough, perhaps, to satisfy the thousands of his countrymen who had died before he was even born.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Where we are going, Ivan Yurievich, it will be colder still."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Putin clapped his captain's shoulder. Was his affection feigned or real? Marko wondered. Probably real. Ramius was an honest man, and he recognized that this short, loud oaf did have some human feelings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Why is it, Comrade Captain, that you always seem glad to leave the Rodina and go to sea?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ramius smiled behind his binoculars. "A seaman has one country, Ivan Yurievich, but two wives. You never understand that. Now I go to my other wife, the cold, heartless one that owns my soul." Ramius paused. The smile vanished. "My only wife, now."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Putin was quiet for once, Marko noted. The political officer had been there, had cried real tears as the coffin of polished pine rolled into the cremation chamber. For Putin the death of Natalia Bogdanova Ramius had been a cause of grief, but beyond that the act of an uncaring God whose existence he regularly denied. For Ramius it had been a crime committed not by God but the State. An unnecessary, monstrous crime, one that demanded punishment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ice." The lookout pointed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Loose-pack ice, starboard side of the channel, or perhaps something calved off the east-side glacier. We'll pass well clear," Kamarov said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Captain!" The bridge speaker had a metallic voice. "Message from fleet headquarters."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Read it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"'Exercise area clear. No enemy vessels in vicinity. Proceed as per orders. Signed, Korov, Fleet Commander.'"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Acknowledged," Ramius said. The speaker clicked off. "So, no Amerikantsi about?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You doubt the fleet commander?" Putin inquired.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I hope he is correct," Ramius replied, more sincerely than his political officer would appreciate. "But you remember our briefings."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Putin shifted on his feet. Perhaps he was feeling the cold.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Those American 688-class submarines, Ivan, the Los Angeleses. Remember what one of their officers told our spy? That they could sneak up on a whale and bugger it before it knew they were there? I wonder how the KGB got that bit of information. A beautiful Soviet agent, trained in the ways of the decadent West, too skinny, the way the imperialists like their women, blond hair . . ." The captain grunted amusement. "Probably the American officer was a boastful boy, trying to find a way to do something similar to our agent, no? And feeling his liquor, like most sailors. Still. The American Los Angeles class, and the new British Trafalgars, those we must guard against. They are a threat to us."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The Americans are good technicians, Comrade Captain," Putin said, "but they are not giants. Their technology is not so awesome. Nasha lutcha," he concluded. Ours is better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ramius nodded thoughtfully, thinking to himself that zampoliti really ought to know something about the ships they supervised, as mandated by Party doctrine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ivan, didn't the farmers around Gorkiy tell you it is the wolf you do not see that you must fear? But don't be overly concerned. With this ship we will teach them a lesson, I think."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"As I told the Main Political Administration," Putin clapped Ramius' shoulder again, "Red October is in the best of hands!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ramius and Kamarov both smiled at that. You son of a bitch! the captain thought, saying in front of my men that you must pass on my fitness to command! A man who could not command a rubber raft on a calm day! A pity you will not live to eat those words, Comrade Political Officer, and spend the rest of your life in the gulag for that misjudgment. It would almost be worth leaving you alive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A few minutes later the chop began to pick up, making the submarine roll. The movement was accentuated by their height above the deck, and Putin made excuses to go below. Still a weak-legged sailor. Ramius shared the observation silently with Kamarov, who smiled agreement. Their unspoken contempt for the zampolit was a most un-Soviet thought.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The next hour passed quickly. The water grew rougher as they approached the open sea, and their icebreaker escort began to wallow on the swells. Ramius watched her with interest. He had never been on an icebreaker, his entire career having been in submarines. They were more comfortable, but also more dangerous. He was accustomed to the danger, though, and the years of experience would stand him in good stead now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sea buoy in sight, Captain." Kamarov pointed. The red lighted buoy was riding actively on the waves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Control room, what is the sounding?" Ramius asked over the bridge telephone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"One hundred meters below the keel, Comrade Captain."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Increase speed to two-thirds, come left ten degrees." Ramius looked at Kamarov. "Signal our course change to Purga, and hope he doesn't turn the wrong way."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kamarov reached for the small blinker light stowed under the bridge coaming. The Red October began to accelerate slowly, her 30,000-ton bulk resisting the power of her engines. Presently the bow wave grew to a three-meter standing arc of water; man-made combers rolled down the missile deck, splitting against the front of the sail. The Purga altered course to starboard, allowing the submarine to pass well clear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ramius looked aft at the bluffs of the Kola Fjord. They had been carved to this shape millennia before by the remorseless pressure of towering glaciers. How many times in his twenty years of service with the Red Banner Northern Fleet had he looked at the wide, flat U-shape? This would be the last. One way or another, he'd never go back. Which way would it turn out? Ramius admitted to himself that he didn't much care. Perhaps the stories his grandmother had taught him were true, about God and the reward for a good life. He hoped so-it would be good if Natalia were not truly dead. In any case, there was no turning back. He had left a letter in the last mailbag taken off before sailing. There was no going back after that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Kamarov, signal to Purga: 'Diving at'"-he checked his watch-"'1320 hours. Exercise OCTOBER FROST begins as scheduled. You are released to other assigned duties. We will return as scheduled.'"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kamarov worked the trigger on the blinker light to transmit the message. The Purga responded at once, and Ramius read the flashing signal unaided: "IF THE WHALES DON'T EAT YOU. GOOD LUCK TO RED OCTOBER!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ramius lifted the phone again, pushing the button for the sub's radio room. He had the same message transmitted to fleet headquarters, Severomorsk. Next he addressed the control room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Depth under the keel?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"One hundred forty meters, Comrade Captain."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Prepare to dive." He turned to the lookout and ordered him below. The boy moved towards the hatch. He was probably glad to return to the warmth below, but took the time for one last look at the cloudy sky and receding cliffs. Going to sea on a submarine was always exciting, and always a little sad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Clear the bridge. Take the conn when you get below, Gregoriy." Kamarov nodded and dropped down the hatch, leaving the captain alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ramius made one last careful scan of the horizon. The sun was barely visible aft, the sky leaden, the sea black except for the splash of whitecaps. He wondered if he were saying goodbye to the world. If so, he would have preferred a more cheerful view of it.</p></p><h2>Look Inside Things That Go</h2><p>Look Inside Things That Go</p><p>&#39;A brilliantly written factual book with a fun, exciting and stimulating design&#39; - First4Dads</p><h2>The Designing for Growth Field Book: A Step-by-Step Project Guide (Columbia Business School Publishing)</h2><p><i>Designing for Growth: A Design Thinking Tool Kit for Managers</i> (D4G) showed how organizations can use design thinking to boost innovation and drive growth.

Three foundational chapters form the basis of the entire book: experts develop insight by isolating patterns in data; they convert those insights to wealth by crafting a unique positioning for which few available substitutes exist; and their confidence grows as the marketplace embraces their application of expertise. The next fifteen chapters--building on that foundation--each answer a single question, starting with the role of expertise in a developed society, how important it is for experts to love the hard work required to hone their expertise, and how to see all that in the context of their own purpose in the world. We pause to dig deeper by examining the very narrow overlap between expertise and entrepreneurship: the narrow slice of humanity for which this book was written, with a nod to how easy it is for those entrepreneurial experts to be pulled off mission to explore new things. What are the critical positioning mistakes to avoid? Are there helpful ways to keep your deep, narrow expertise from blinding you to a broader, wider relevance? How might you frame your expertise in horizontal or vertical terms or a combination of both? There are core principles for this and they start with distinguishing between strategy and implementation. What are the earlier and then later tests to validate your positioning? What are the most effective ways to demonstrate your expertise, and conversely the activities most important to avoid? If you are an entrepreneurial expert selling advice for a living, you ll absorb deeper and deeper insight each time you scour it. It emerges from the trenches, and is written for experts in the trenches. Following the three foundational chapters (A, B, C) that open the book, there are fifteen chapters that build on that: The Role of Expertise in a Developed Society; The Interplay Between Expertise and Fulfillment; The Why for Your Entrepreneurial Expertise; Combining Expertise and Entrepreneurship; The Relevance and Sustainability of Expertise; Positioning Mistakes and Why We Make Them; Practicing Expertise Within a Broader Context; Distinguishing Between Vertical and Horizontal Expertise; Principles for the Less Exchangeable Positioning of Expertise; Distinguishing Expertise from Implementation; Five Early Tests for the Positioning of Your Expertise; Demonstrating Expertise; Not Demonstrating Expertise; How Expertise Unfolds: A Recap; and The Long Game: Maintaining Relevant Expertise. The book is fully illustrated in color, is a hardback (case bound), and has a full-color dust jacket.</p><p>David C. Baker grew up with a tribe of Mayan Indians in a remote village in the highlands of Guatemala. He is an author, speaker, and advisor to entrepreneurial experts. This is his fifth book. He is a helicopter and airplane pilot, an avid photographer, and taught high performance motorcycle riding/racing. Based in Nashville, he has visited and worked all over the world. He is married, has two boys, two daughters-in-law, and multiple grandchildren. His work has been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Fast Company, USA Today, Inc. Magazine, and Forbes. He has keynoted major conference all over the world. You can find the microsite at expertise.is on the internet.Genuine expertise has become more valuable than ever--and in this smart and timely book, David talks frankly about how to leverage your own expertise into a sustainable business. This book is essential reading for entrepreneurs in any field. --Dan Pink, author of Drive and To Sell is Human<br><br>Baker (Managing (Right) for the First Time, 2010, etc.) targets an audience inhabiting the narrow overlap between entrepreneurship and expertise, that is, individuals and firms providing insight and advice to others for pay. He opens with three foundational chapters that summarize how expertise flows from focus, how greater proficiency makes a consultant less interchangeable with others, and how precise positioning can achieve a price premium. Sixteen short but information-packed chapters follow, fleshing out these themes in detail. Baker explores many issues that confront advisers, from self-confidence and work fulfillment to managing client relationships and maintaining relevance over the long term. Each chapter advances his argument that proper positioning is the key to success. He draws relevant illustrations from his decades of experience and offers pointed questions and concrete metrics that readers can use to assess their situations. Throughout, he urges consultants to make courageous decisions to narrow and deepen their knowledge rather than holding themselves out as capable of tackling any assignment. He emphasizes the power of saying no and recommends keeping a getting to know list of subject matter gaps to research and master. Baker s writing reflects the approach he counsels. His tone is confident and authoritative yet tempered with self-deprecating humor. He projects an insouciant command of numerous topics without sounding like a know-it-all. His deep thinking on the subject manifests in clear, succinct prose and measured wit that make the reading easy and enjoyable ( Charge your batteries so that you can do the hard work...and put a hard hat on because some of this work is painful ). Chapters move briskly, and he is particularly nimble with transitions that orient the reader and enhance orderly flow. Despite the book s focus on consulting agencies, other professionals who provide expertise or whose livelihoods rely on it physicians, scientists, writers, etc. should find relevant and useful ideas. Since Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung appeared in 1964, numerous authors and designers have emulated its color and small format in hopes of becoming the little red book in their categories. This compact, illustrated volume makes a strong bid to become the standard-bearer on selling expertise. A must-read for entrepreneurial experts that also will have a broad appeal for other professionals. --Kirkus Reviews<br><br>Experts crush generalists all day long and yet some still advocate for building broad, diverse businesses that cannot possibly match an expert's depth. Baker dismantles that argument, showing why experts will always rule, while patiently mapping the steps to deeper expertise, greater impact, and higher profit. --Blair Enns, author of The Win Without Pitching Manifesto</p><h2>The Human Being Diet: A blueprint for feasting and fasting your way to feeling, looking and being your best</h2><p>Petronella trained at the Institute for Optimum Nutrition and the Natura Foundation and she&#39;s also a Functional Medicine practitioner.

(What Was?)</h2><p>Back in 775 BC, athletes from all over Ancient Greece came together to compete in various games. The contests were held every four years and winning athletes brought honor and respect to their homelands.<br><br>The tradition of the Olympic Games faded over time until 1896, when they were brought back to life. The first modern Olympics were held in Athens, Greece, with over two hundred athletes from fourteen countries.&nbsp;Today, nearly three thousand years after the first Games, the Summer Olympics attract one hundred thousand top athletes from over two hundred countries. Billions of fans around the world cheer on their national teams to bring back the gold.</p><p>Gail Herman has written several biographies, including <i>Who Was Jackie Robinson?</i> and <i>What Is the World Series?</i><b>What Are the Summer Olympics?</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Every four years during the summer, athletes from every corner of the globe meet to compete in the Olympics&#x2014;the greatest sports contest on earth.<br> &nbsp;<br> For about two weeks, athletes test their skill, their strength, and their luck in more than three hundred events. Arenas for the Olympics become a world stage, with billions of fans following the Games on TV.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> There have been generals, princes, and movie stars who have competed in the Olympics.

There, in a valley surrounded by gentle hills, a mirror is held up to the sun. The rays light the flame on a torch.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Olympic torch will be carried to the city hosting the Games. The journey connects the Games of today to the Games of the ancient past. Long ago, fires burned in front of temples to honor Greek gods. Today the torch is passed from person to person moving by foot, car, train, boat, plane, through countries, across oceans, over mountains. On the way to Beijing, China, in 2008, the torch even reached the highest point in the world, Mount Everest. <br> &nbsp;<br> But no matter its path, the relay ends at the Olympic stadium of the host city in time for the opening ceremony.

Until now, most of Sailor Jerry&#39;s work has been controlled by a handful of collectors, seen only at museum or art gallery exhibitions or in short-run, self-published books. Here is a sizeable portion of Sailor Jerry&#39;s stencils, the newest tattoo collectible, spanning his tattoo career, from the 1940s to the early 1970s. The basic line work of hundreds of his staple and surprisingly beautiful designs--pin-ups, roses, bluebirds, hearts, and banners, and Jerry&#39;s infamous military/political cartoons. The stencils themselves were handcut in celluloid, vinyl or acetate sheets by the master himself for use during his day-to-day thriving tattoo trade in downtown Honolulu. They are, in the best sense, permanent tattoos carved in plastic, enduring through time. In their original condition, most carry residual charcoal dust from their last use. All are signed by Jerry with one of his several distinctive signatures. This is the only book of its kind--a workbook for artists, and a design catalog for folk art historians. The value of the stencils is included, along with descriptions of stencils and their usage and a glossary of tattoo terminology.</p><p>Kate Hellenbrand is an award-winning tattoo artist and writer. She began tattooing in 1971 in New York City, where she lives today. She worked with Sailor Jerry in his Honolulu shop in 1972 and remained his friend until his death in 1973.</p><h2>The New Successful Large Account Management: Maintaining and Growing Your Most Important Assets -- Your Customers</h2><p>For the Accounts You Can&#39;t Afford to Lose: The Strategies that Will Keep Your Customers Coming Back Whether your company has $50,000 or $5 million in sales, chances are that at least half of your revenue comes from a few crucial accounts.

The longer spouses wait to learn these skills, the greater their chance of wanting to bail, yet Gungor makes it easy for couples to bring their relationship to the next level.</p><p>Mark Gungor is a pastor, motivational speaker, author, and musician.

Mark and his wife Debbie have been married for thirty-two years and have two grown children and two grandchildren.<b></b><p><b> 1<br> The Perfect Mate </b> </p><p> Deb and I had flown into Raleigh, North Carolina, to do one of our <i>Laugh Your Way to a Better Marriage</i> seminars. Usually during my weekend events I speak for up to six hours or more, so if I am not careful I can overwork my voice. In preparation for an event, I try to limit my jabbering and generally turn down any requests to meet with people, do interviews, and so on. However, the Friday morning before the start of the Raleigh event, my good friend and host pastor, Steve Coronna, asked if I would join him and his wife Connie on the set of their TV program, <i>Making Your Marriage Work</i>. My reluctance to do three television programs on the day of a seminar was mitigated only by my friendship with Steve. </p><p> The plan was to leave the hotel at 9:15 a.m. and drive to the studio to meet them. I am not exactly a morning kind of guy, and being true to form, I slept in as late as possible and began to shower and get dressed only at the last possible minute. After I shaved and combed what hair I have left, I went to get a fresh pair of underwear out of my suitcase. However, I could not find any. Since I am a typical man and unable to find something even if it's right under my nose, I did not panic, but simply called out to my wife, who was now in the bathroom. </p><p> "Hey, Debbie, where are my underwear?" </p><p> "They're right there in the front of your suitcase," she answered. </p><p> "No," I retorted. "I looked. There's nothing there." </p><p> Exasperated, Debbie shot out from the bathroom to the suitcase to try and find what I had obviously missed. After a few moments, however, she started to giggle and said, "Well, I guess we didn't pack any." </p><p> <i>Didn't pack any?!</i> I started to panic. <i>No underwear?!</i> My mind began to race: <i>I have people to meet; television shows to tape! I don't have time to deal with, 'I guess we didn't pack any.'</i> </p><p> <i>Perhaps yesterday's undies</i>, I thought, switching from panic to resolution mode. A little gross, but it seemed like a plausible plan at the time. Then I realized my drawers were lying wet on the bathroom floor and there was no time to dry them out. I had to go <i>now</i> if I was going to be on time. </p><p> Only two options lay before me: a) go au naturel with no restraints -- <i>freely</i>, as it were; or b) do the <i>unthinkable</i> -- wear my wife's underwear. As I pondered the options, a pair of my wife's undies caught my eye. They were made of simple cotton, and, were it not for "Victoria's Secret" stamped all over the elastic band, they almost looked like a pair of men's skivvies. </p><p> <i>Dare I</i>? I mused. </p><p> Now, every man I have ever shared this story with has told me they would have chosen option "a," and never option "b," even under threat of death or bodily harm. For most men, wearing women's underwear is <i>not</i> an option -- there are <i>way</i> too many conflicting implications. But I just could not see spending my day underwear<i>less</i>. I can't handle that much <i>freedom</i> in my life. I would have found it extremely distracting. </p><p> So, option "b" it was. I quickly slipped on my wife's undies, finished getting dressed, and headed out the door, giving what I had just done very little thought. </p><p> About five miles down the road, it started to dawn on me that I was sitting in a pair of underwear that had "<i>Victoria's Secret</i>" imprinted over and over again on the waistband. I thought to myself, <i>Good grief! What if I'm in an accident</i>? I imagined myself lying on the side of the road while the medics tried to remove my pants to save my life. I saw myself fighting them off, screaming at the top of my lungs, "Let me die! Let me die!" </p><p> Soon I was at my destination, and I tried to focus on taping the programs to be aired over the next three weeks. You can imagine the irony I felt as I looked into the camera and threw out a challenge for the men in the audience to be real men, not the all-too-familiar men who live in a virtual world of TV, video games, and computer porn -- yet all the while I was sitting in a pair of women's underwear! It was a struggle to concentrate on what I was saying. </p><p> After the taping, while we were waiting to be seated for lunch, I could hold my secret no longer. I leaned over to Steve and Connie and told them I had a confession to make. Few things get people's attention like an open confession, so they gathered close to me as I whispered the events of that morning. When I finally got to the part where I revealed I was standing there with them in a pair of my wife's underwear, which I had been wearing all morning, Steve screamed and tried to get as far away from me as possible. (Did I mention guys have issues with this kind of thing?) He continued with lunch only as long as I agreed not to touch him. He also asked me to never mention his name when telling this story. (But, <i>hey</i>, what are friends for?) </p><p> <b>The Moral of the Story</b> </p><p> I reveal this self-deprecating story to illustrate a point. If you are going to survive unexpected circumstances and disappointments, you are going to have to be willing to change, to adjust, to work with what you have, and to commit to doing things you normally wouldn't have chosen to do. Despite our best efforts and intentions, life doesn't always turn out the way we have hoped and planned. This is especially true when it comes to relationships between men and women. </p><p> Love can be deceitful. It starts out so easily. In fact, it is the ease of the relationship that convinces us that the other person is "the one." We are so comfortable with them. They are incredibly easy to talk to. We can just be ourselves around them. With seemingly no effort at all, we experience a sense of joy just by being around them. </p><p> "It is so easy," we reason, "this person must be <i>the one</i>!" </p><p> "Yes," your romance-starved heart answers, "this is it -- true love is <i>always</i> easy!" </p><p> So we take the plunge, we make the big commitment, we promise, "Till death do us part." And we know it's right because it's easy. <i>Easy</i> is always a sign from God that things are right. <i>Right</i>? </p><p> But after the "I do's" have been exchanged, life kicks in. And guess what? <i>It ain't easy</i>. </p><p> Men and women begin their journey believing that fate has caused them to meet each other, and then they date and end up at the altar. They think that since they have spent so much quality time with each other, they truly know each other. They know what to expect and, therefore, feel the relationship is safe -- they have discovered the <i>perfect one</i>. However, due to the intoxicating nature of the dating process, people don't know each other nearly as well as they think. </p><p> So when life hits, <i>shock and awe</i> set in. <i>Shock</i> because the differences that attracted them to each other now repel them. <i>Awe</i> because they are now frustrated and angry and feel that their whole marriage is simply awful. </p><p> We read in the Old Testament, "Hope deferred makes the heart sick." Simply stated, when things don't go the way you hoped they would, it is easy to get "heart sick" -- to lose your <i>oomph</i>, to want to quit and get away from what disappointed you. But that is a mistake. </p><p> The truth is that such lofty ideals of romantic perfection actually work to make people's marriages worse, not better. Since these ideals are rarely if ever realized, dissatisfaction rules the day. You were smoking marital ganja if you expected marriage to be a life filled with constant waves of joy, where every morning birds sing you awake and little bunnies help you sweep the floors as the chipmunks wash the dishes. </p><p> It may be a hard pill to swallow, but it doesn't take the ladies long to discover that -- though they were worshiped and coddled like beautiful princesses during the dating experience, <i>and</i> though they married the guy expecting to step into a long life of being the object of worship and coddling -- it doesn't last. Generally, women end up feeling as if they are the property of the Pumpkin Eater (who, according to Mother Goose, has his little woman neatly tucked away in his pumpkin shell, there to keep her very well). Women discover that their Prince Charming is more pauper than prince, and the man of her dreams morphs into looking more like the monster from her nightmares. </p><p> Similarly, men get disappointed and offended, but only by the idea that we could ever disappoint a woman. "How can this be?" men reason. "Our moms always said we were perfect." And we guys hate to lose the "Prince Charming" label. The problem is that we can't begin to comprehend why being married would take anywhere near the energy dating did. We have won the girl. The girl said "yes." The boy said "I do." Everything seems set, so we assume we can now begin to redirect our attentions, formerly used to chase our bride-<i>to-be</i>, to new pursuits. There are new hills to climb, new wars to win, new seas to cross, and of course, video games to play. Sadly, many men think "I do" means "I'm done." This is because we generally approach relationships with a conquer-and-possess mind-set. And once men <i>possess</i>, we are ready to move on to new ground. </p><p> In a way, what we possess "disappears," kind of the way a new car disappears after we own it for six months, and we often cease to give those we love significant attention. We don't do it to be cruel, we just don't get <i>why</i> we would keep fighting and striving to secure something we <i>already have</i>. Sadly, the romantic chase of courtship gives way to the thoughtlessness, inconsiderate behavior, and even rude assumption of ownership. (I'm not saying this is right or that it has to stay this way, it just is for the average guy.) Our shock and awe in marriage have to do with the discovery that our wives no longer think we are the cat's meow. After all, we are men, the bearers of the magic that accompanies our gender -- endowed to us by the male penis. </p><p> Ah, wretched disappointment -- it makes us sick. And when marriages are filled with disappointed wives and offended men, it do...</p></p><h2>Carry On: A Story of Resilience, Redemption, and an Unlikely Family</h2><p><p><strong>NAACP Image Award Finalist, and Winner of the 2016 Friends of American Writers Literary Award and the Christopher Award</strong></p><p><strong>A&nbsp;deeply moving memoir about<em> </em>the unexpected bonds that would<em> </em>transform three lives.<em></em></strong></p><p>Lisa Fenn<strong> </strong>produced human-interest features for ESPN for over a decade, but one particular story came into her life and never left.

In the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>All Your Worth</i>, mother/daughter team Elizabeth Warren and Amelia Warren Tyagi&#x2014;authors of the acclaimed <i>The Two-Income Trap</i>&#x2014;tell you the truth about money. The authors lay out a groundbreaking approach to getting control of your money so you can finally start building the life you&#x2019;ve always wanted. The result of more than twenty years of intensive research, <i>All Your Worth</i> offers you a step-by-step plan that will let you master your finances&#x2014;for the rest of your life.<br> <br>The secret? It&#x2019;s simple, really: get your money in balance. Warren and Tyagi show you how to balance your money into three essential parts: the Must-Haves (the bills you have to pay every month), the Wants (some fun money for right now), and your Savings (to build a better tomorrow). No complicated budgets, no keeping track of every penny. Warren and Tyagi will show you a whole new way of looking at money&#x2014;and yourself&#x2014;that will help you get your finances on track so you can enjoy peace of mind for the rest of your life.</p><p><b>Elizabeth Warren</b>, one of the nation&#x2019;s most influential progressives and a longtime champion of working families and the middle class, is the senior senator from Massachusetts&nbsp;and a Democratic candidate for president.

Hard work and good intentions are no longer enough. Security, comfort, lasting prosperity -- you want it, you work hard for it, and yet the worry remains. Real financial peace seems so hard to achieve. </p><p> You can't count on good old-fashioned hard work the way your parents did. Go to school, get a good job, do your work, don't go crazy with spending, and everything will work out, right? Not anymore. That advice may have worked in your parents' day, but today you have to be <i>smart</i> with your money. Not just a little smart, but super smart. You have to learn the new rules -- the rules nobody told you and nobody talks about. And you have to learn them fast. </p><p> Just for a moment, forget what you know about money. Forget about your bills. Forget the size of your paycheck. Forget your shopping trips and the shoes you just bought. We want to give you a new perspective on your money, a different way to think about it. We want you to explore new possibilities. </p><p> What if we told you that this book could show you how to cover your bills, without worry or fear? No more bounced checks. No more anxiety about how you'll make it through the month. Just the power to pay your bills on time, and then to relax in security and comfort. </p><p> Now, what if we told you that on top of showing you how to conquer your bills, this book could show you how to have some money for fun? No living like a Scrooge. No asking yourself every minute, <i>"Can I really afford this?"</i> Just some cash in your pocket for plain old just-because-you-feel-like-it <i>fun.</i> </p><p> And now, suppose we told you that in addition to all of this, you could still have money to save? Money to get <i>ahead,</i> each and every month. Enough money so that you could finally start to dream a little -- and make real progress toward those dreams. Enough to build some <i>real</i> wealth. </p><p> And what if we said you could do all this without counting pennies, without carrying around a calculator, and without thinking constantly about money? In fact, after a little up-front work, you could stop thinking about money altogether, and spend your days focusing on the things that really matter. </p><p> Would you keep reading? </p><p> </p><b>Is This Book for You?</b> <p> At this point, you may be thinking, "Aw c'mon. I've looked at these financial books before. All windup and no delivery. They take your $26 and leave you no better off." All those get-rich-quick schemes that assume you have thousands of dollars lying around, just waiting for the right investment. All those chapters on how to buy stock options, how to choose a vacation home, how to plan your estate so that your kids can inherit millions without paying taxes. Who are they kidding? </p><p> Or maybe you bought one of those "Billionaire Tells All" books, which promised to unlock all the secrets to becoming fabulously wealthy. And here you are, still trying to figure out how the heck you're supposed to "make your money work for you." </p><p> And then there are the lectures on what <i>they</i> think your problem is. <i>"Stop taking expensive vacations." "Shift to a better mutual fund."</i> But what if you haven't taken a real vacation in ages? What if you don't have two nickels for a mutual fund, or maybe you aren't quite sure what a mutual fund is? </p><p> We'll let you in on a secret: <i>Those books are not written for you.</i> They are written for people who already have plenty of money, people who don't worry about making ends meet. Oh sure, the store is glad to take your money, but those books are written for people who are already rich and who want to get just a little bit richer. So, where is <i>your</i> book? </p><p> Right here. <i>All Your Worth</i> is for anyone who ever worries about money. For anyone who works hard and plays by the rules, but discovers that the rules have changed. For anyone who wants to build wealth, but isn't sure how to get started. In short, this book is for anyone who wants to get control of his or her money once and for all, to stop worrying and start living a richer, fuller life. </p><p> </p>This book is for anyone who wants control of his or her money, once and for all. <p> If you have already solved all your money problems, if you are secure about your future and never worry about money, if all you want is a book to help you get a little richer, then keep shopping. This isn't your book. But if you are like the rest of us, and if you are ready to take charge of your money, then this is your chance to make some profound changes in your life. </p><p> </p><b>Building Your Worth Over a Lifetime -- A Plan That Works</b> <p> We want to be clear right from the start: We are not going to tell you how to get rich working ten minutes a day. We are not going to claim that you can live like a millionaire on $20,000 a year. And we are not going to pretend that you can retire at age 32. We figure you are too smart to believe that kind of twaddle anyway. </p><p> We are also not going to say that if you'll just shift to generic toilet paper and put $5 a week in the bank, all your problems will instantly disappear. A few pennies here and a few pennies there, and the next thing you know, you will be debt-free, investment-rich, and lighting cigars with Donald Trump. Nope, we're not selling that brand of snake oil. </p><p> In fact, you won't get any count-your-pennies advice here. And for a very good reason: Penny-counting advice is downright dangerous. That's right--<i>dangerous.</i> Trying to count every penny won't solve your financial problems. But it <i>will</i> distract you from the real issues. (It will also provide you with lots of opportunities to fight with your loved ones and make everyone miserable!) This book skips the pennies and goes straight to the heart of the matter -- getting real control over your dollars. </p><p> Here's a little secret that the other financial books won't tell you: Savvy money managers don't spend a lot of time looking for ways to save a few pennies. They charge right ahead to the big-ticket items, looking to make high-impact changes in the shortest period of time. They don't sweat the small stuff. And neither will we. </p><p> </p>Savvy money Managers start with the dollars, not the pennies. <p> We're going to work on the big stuff, not the pennies. This means that what we're going to do is completely different from those other books. But we'll do it anyway. Why? Because it <i>works.</i> It will take some effort at first, but once you get going, you can manage your bills <i>and</i> start some serious wealth creation. </p><p> How can we be so sure this will work? Because <i>All Your Worth</i> isn't based on gut reasoning or lucky guesses. It is based on more than twenty years of intensive research, drawing on the experiences of literally thousands of people from across the country. </p><p> This book doesn't waste time lecturing you on problems someone dreamed up. It focuses on the <i>real</i> issues that regular people struggle with every day. And it offers workable, lifetime solutions designed to help ordinary people get control over their money once and for all. </p><p> </p><i>All Your Worth</i> is based on more than twenty years of intensive research. <p> </p><b>The Origins of <i>All Your Worth</i></b> <p> One of us (Elizabeth) is a professor at Harvard Law School. I have spent decades writing academic books and teaching an entire generation of law students about the rules of money. I have gone before the United States Supreme Court, the White House, and Congress to talk about those rules. I have raised so much noise on television, on radio, and in the newspapers about financial trouble in America that I was named one of the Fifty Most Influential Women Lawyers in America. But I have spent a lot of my time out of the spotlight, giving advice to people -- friends, family, folks who participated in our various studies. These "What can you do right here, right now" conversations have become a big part of my life. </p><p> The other of us (Amelia) is a financial consultant, with an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. I started my career as a consultant with McKinsey &amp; Company, where I advised some of the largest corporations in America. Then I left the big-business world to cofound HealthAllies, a new kind of company dedicated to helping families get more affordable health care. Today I spend my time writing or speaking on the radio about finance, and working with people who want to get control of their money. </p><p> We are also mother and daughter, two women who come from a long line of hardscrabble Okies. Shortly before I (Elizabeth) was born, my father lost the family's life savings to a crooked business partner. During my growing-up years, Daddy sold carpeting at a department store and worked as a maintenance man for an apartment complex. I got my first job at 9, rocking a neighbor's colicky baby in the afternoons so his mama could get a few hours of sleep. By age 11 I was taking in sewing, and at 16 I worked the mail desk at an insurance office. My college financial aid applications classified my family as "poor," although I never thought we were any worse off than our neighbors. </p><p> I was married at 19, and Amelia was born three years later. She spent her early years tagging along while I went back to school. We lived on a budget that was so tight that I still remember crying with relief when my mother-in-law offered me one of her dresses to wear to a job interview. (She was seven inches shorter than I am, so you can imagine how ungainly I looked!) </p><p> I (Amelia) spent a lot of my childhood in a moving van, as my mom moved from place to place, finishing law school and then taking teaching jobs at various colleges. First New Jersey, then Texas, then Michigan, then Pennsylvania, and finally off to Massachusetts. I ended up going to nine public schools over twelve years, so I certainly know what it's like to adapt quickly! I headed back to Pennsylvania for graduate school, where I m...</p></p><h2>WP222 - Popular Christmas Songs Level 2 - Bastien</h2><p>Not only is this outstanding series of popular Christmas favorites appealing to students, it is the most pedagogically structured choice of teachers everyewhere.

That&#x2019;s why he&#x2019;s summoned his children home to Oregon before announcing his run for governor. Sixteen years ago, his rival&#x2019;s son, Harley Taggert, drowned in the murky waters of Lake Arrowhead.

She lives with her family and three rambunctious dogs in the Pacific Northwest. Readers can visit her website at www.lisajackson.com and find her on Facebook.In a letter to readers, Jackson (Cold Blooded, etc.) declares this a "spanking brand new edition" of her 1999 romantic suspense novel, complete with new twists and a new ending. As such, it should generate plenty of excitement among her fans, but new readers may be put off by the book's overabundance of sex and violence. After being approached to run for Governor of Oregon, Dutch Holland vows to lay the skeletons of his past to rest. He soon learns, however, that they won't go away so easily. Sixteen years earlier, his rival's younger son, Harley Taggert, was murdered, and Dutch believes one of his own daughters may have been responsible. Now, journalist Kane Moran has returned home to crack open the case and write a book about it, despite the fact that his actions may hurt his old crush, single mom Claire Holland, Dutch's daughter. Harley's brother, Weston Taggert, a typical animal-abusing sexual deviant, also hates Dutch and would do anything to discredit the Hollands. The relationship between Kane, a lowborn, abused bad boy, and the unreachable, well-off Claire follows a familiar path, but the pages practically sizzle when they're together. Stock secondary characters and predictable family dramas leech away some of the suspense, but Jackson livens up her story with a final, dizzying twist. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>How to Quilt: A Beginner&#x2019;s Guide to Learn How to Quilt Step-by-Step</h2><p><p><b><strong>Are You Curious About Quilt Making?</strong></b></p><p>Quilt making is an opportunity for people to express themselves creatively with fabric and color.

In <i>Fully Present</i>, leading mindfulness researchers and educators Dr. Sue Smalley and Diana Winston provide an all-in-one guide for anyone interested in bringing mindfulness to daily life as a means of enhancing well-being. <i>Fully Present </i>provides both a scientific explanation for how mindfulness positively and powerfully affects the brain and the body as well as practical guidance to develop both a practice and mindfulness in daily living, not only through meditation but also during daily experiences, such as waiting in line at the supermarket, exercising, or facing difficult news.<br></p><p><b>Susan Smalley, PhD</b>, is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Psychiatry at UCLA.

She lives in Southern California.<br><br>dianawinston.comYou wouldn't go through your day after having left your leg at home, so why are so many of us living lives with our minds left behind? Smalley, a former professor of biology, and Winston, a former Buddhist nun, answer this question and enable readers to remedy the absent-minded lifestyle. As founder/director and director, respectively, of UCLA's Mindful Awareness Research Center, the authors draw on their experience of bringing mindfulness to the masses and present the scientific side of mindfulness with an artful approach that results in a well-rounded synthesis accessible to scholars and laymen alike. Research studies, personal accounts, and practical applications illuminate mindfulness as a form of meditation; with activities as simple as breathing, listening, and walking, the practice can be easily incorporated into any lifestyle. Though a surprisingly extensive list of benefits from mindfulness is supported by what current research exists, the authors simultaneously acknowledge that more needs to be done and they find encouragement in positive results that reveal mindfulness as a simple yet profound solution to daily problems. Smalley and Winston will pique interest in living a completely present life, even if what that means has yet to be fully understood. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With Granny Relda desperately scrambling to pay Mayor Heart&#x2019;s outrageous taxes on humans, the sisters Grimm tackle their first solo case&#x2014;with a little help from Puck, of course.<br><br> Meanwhile, their old friend Mr. Canis seems to be losing his grip on his human self, becoming more like the Big Bad Wolf every day.

Perfect as a gift, this book brings the Easter story to life in a whole new way for children.</p><p><p><b>Agostino Traini</b> was born in Rome in 1961. He creates illustrated books for children, activity books, delightful crafts and paper objects, and designs and builds colorful furniture and wooden objects from his home in Italy.</p>PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;Traini illustrates the resurrection and ascension of Jesus and Pentecost in a pop-up book format for young readers. Using a color palette of lavenders, blues, and cool-toned browns, Traini's cartoon rendering of the Easter story is visually pleasing, though the text is quite simplistic. The book dives straight into the resurrection and provides almost no background information other than: "It had been three days since Jesus died on a cross, and his friends were sad." Additionally, there is little sense of the passage of time between events and Peter is the only named disciple. The narrative is peppered with recognizable quotes ("Peace be with you"), which can aid children in connecting this story to Mass. Younger kids will enjoy the friendly-looking birds, cats, and goats that populate the edges of the scenes, while smaller details, such as lilies, can prompt discussions on symbolism. All of the figures are illustrated with the same light tan skin. The pop-ups are the obvious draw of this work; the horizontal format allows Traini to add depth to his scenes and gives readers the chance to linger. VERDICT A slight but nonetheless appealing take on the resurrection for large libraries with a well-visited religion section.&#x2014;Della Farrell, School Library Journal</p><h2>Inspector Flytrap in The Goat Who Chewed Too Much (Inspector Flytrap #3) (The Flytrap Files)</h2><p>When he loses a crime-solving partner to a master criminal who is also threatening the city, Flytrap engages in a wacky investigation to clear the name of his goat sidekick, Nina.

It's about so much more than just counting your carbs and getting exercise. Due to constantly increasing hormones during pregnancy, your insulin needs constantly change, too. While no two women's pregnancies will be alike, the timing of those anticipated insulin adjustments will be similar. In this book, Ginger Vieira and Jennifer Smith, CDE &amp; RD, guide you through preparing for pregnancy, from conception to birth, and through the challenges of managing your blood sugars during postpartum.REVIEWS:" Wow, there&#x2019;s so much information! The first part of the book, Preparing for Pregnancy, is presented quite well. It gives a WWT1D all the information she needs to prepare for pregnancy. But, I have to say, having lived vicariously through three pregnancies I think the Month-To-Month guide is brilliant. It should be read twice. First, all at once, to help a woman plan and prepare for the different stages of pregnancy. Then, slowly, as each phase opens and each experience becomes as emotional as it is physical. A wonderful guide. The personal testimonials that close out the book are a very nice touch." -Victor Van Beuren, Senior Acquisitions Director of ADA Books"If you have type 1 diabetes and are contemplating having a baby, before you do anything&#x2014;and that means anything at all&#x2014;make sure you grab a copy of Pregnancy With Type 1 Diabetes by Ginger Vieira, CHC, CPT and Jennifer C.

A freak accident gives five middle school bullies super powers. But instead of being able to transform into cool super-beings, they take on the characteristics of the kids they bully. Sure their abilities may be at an all-time high, but do they really have what it takes to save their school when their self-esteem is at an all-time low? "Creative, funny, and engaging &#x2013; this book presents a unique look at the dynamics of bullying. With a diverse cast of characters, the book illustrates that bullying affects everyone &#x2013; and that the students who are bullying can change their behavior and make their school a more positive place." &#x2014; PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center</p><p>I am the creator of Mama&#x2019;s Boyz, an award-winning comic strip that has been distributed by King Features Syndicate to close to 900 publications since 1995.

The Offenders tackles this idea while taking on the popular topic of bullying. An accident gives five bullies superpowers. Instead of invisibility or the ability to fly, they are given the traits of the kids they torment. When aliens attack the school and threaten the safety of the world, it's up to The Offenders to draw upon their unique abilities to save humanity. Many kids will be turned off by the book's blatantly overt message about bullying (statistics from awareness websites are interspersed throughout) and lengthy explanations of everyday activities come off as didactic. Back matter includes information already known to a wide variety of children including several slang and texting indexes, brief Spanish and Korean glossaries, as well as a custard recipe briefly mentioned in the text. Even though a multiethnic cast of characters will appeal to those serving diverse populations, The Offenders is an uneven addition to an already glutted field of antibullying titles. Black-and-white cartoon-style drawings fit the superhero theme. This is a below-average book tackling issues deftly handled by previous works, such as Eric Kahn Gale's The Bully Book (HarperCollins, 2013) and Lisa Yee's Warp Speed (Scholastic, 2011).&#x2014;Christopher Lassen, Brooklyn Public Library</p><h2>Louder Than Words: The Power of Uncompromised Living</h2><p>Your character, more than anything else, will impact how much you accomplish in this life.

Whether served as a hearty family dinner, at a potluck with friends, or as the main dish at a football-watching party, chili is a crowd-pleaser. It&#x2019;s slathered over tamales in San Antonio, hot dogs in Detroit, and hamburgers in Los Angeles. It&#x2019;s ladled over spaghetti in Cincinnati, hash browns in St. Louis, and Fritos corn chips in Santa Fe.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>The Chili Cookbook</i>, award-winning author Robb Walsh digs deep into the fascinating history of this quintessential American dish. Who knew the cooking technique traces its history to the ancient Aztecs, or that Hungarian goulash inspired the invention of chili powder?<br> &nbsp;<br> Fans in every region of the country boast the &#x201c;one true recipe,&#x201d; and Robb Walsh recreates them all&#x2014;60 mouth-watering chilis from easy slow-cooker suppers to stunning braised meat creations. There&nbsp;are beef, venison, pork, lamb, turkey, chicken, and shrimp chilis to choose from&#x2014;there is even an entire chapter on vegetarian chili.&nbsp;<i>The Chili Cookbook </i>is sure to satisfy all your chili cravings.</p><p>Veteran food writer and three-time James Beard Award winner ROBB WALSH&nbsp;is the author of more than a dozen cookbooks, including the iconic <i>Tex-Mex Cookbook </i>and <i>Legends of Texas Barbecue</i>. A former restaurant reviewer for the <i>Austin Chronicle</i>, <i>Houston Press,</i> and <i>Houstonia Magazine</i>, Walsh lives in Houston, Texas, and co-owns El Real Tex-Mex Cafe with chef Bryan Caswell. He is a cofounder and board member of Foodways Texas.Introduction<br> If chili is enjoying a revival lately, it&#x2019;s not the second coming&#x2014;more like the third or fourth, depending on when you start counting. The history of chili con carne is deep, dark, and very complicated.<br><br> Mexicans, Texans, New Mexicans, and Midwesterners have been arguing about chili <br> for well over a century. They are still debating what it is, how to spell it, and who invented it. Other subjects of contention include: one &#x201c;L&#x201d; or two in the middle, &#x201c;I&#x201d; or &#x201c;E&#x201d; on the end; tomato versus no tomato, beans versus no beans, ground meat versus hand chopped, and disputes about spices so arcane, they defy rational explanation.<br><br> As a partner in a Tex-Mex restaurant where we serve gallons and gallons of Texas chili every day, I have to confess that I am not an objective observer. But as a student of food history and an enthusiastic consumer, I put my preconceptions aside long enough to research this book. And I was richly rewarded with good chili from unexpected places and amazing (sometimes true) tales.&nbsp;This book delves into the five hundred years of chili history beginning with the Aztec chile stews the conquistadors sampled in the markets of Montezuma in the 1500s and includes chili recipes inspired by the Spanish mission era of the 1700s, when the first chile peppers were cultivated in North America and the cattle-herding traditions of the Texas cowboys were born.<br><br> Several chapters focus on Texas chili, including the San Antonio version of the 1800s, the heyday of the Chili Queens and the Chicago World&#x2019;s Fair of 1894 where Tex-Mex chili created a sensation. The spread of chili across the Midwest in the 1900s takes us for a trip down that highway of memory called Route 66. There are side trips to Ohio, Michigan, and Washington, DC. And finally, we return to the twenty-first century home kitchen, where chili has taken on a new identity <br> as the most modern of American dishes.<br><br> If you love chili, you will probably find some of the recipes in this book comforting and some of them vexing, especially if you&#x2019;re a purist with firmly held ideas about beans or spaghetti or whatever. Suspend your disbelief for a just a bit and trust your taste buds.The modern recipes in the book include lamb chilis, pork chilis, chicken chilis, shrimp chili, and yes, even a whole chapter on meatless chilis (because vegetarians have to eat, too). Recipes for Hungarian goulash, Pakistani keema, and Greek spaghetti sauce are also included as part&nbsp;of my argument that each has played a part in chili&#x2019;s colorful history.<br><br> Some of the cooking instructions are ridiculously simple, and some are more ambitious. Cooking methods have evolved from cast-iron pots on the campfire to the modern stovetop, and now include convenient slow-cooker variations that you can start in the morning and eat when you get home from work.<br> Read a few of the stories and try a few of the recipes collected here, and you may come to the same conclusion I did&#x2014;that chili is both a quintessential American dish and a part of an ancient chile pepper culture that has become deeply ingrained in the whole world&#x2019;s cooking.<br><br> <b>Chili Kitchen Notes</b><br> Before we get started, let&#x2019;s make sure we&#x2019;re all on the same page when it comes to equipment and ingredients.<br><br> <b>Equipment </b>Most recipes in this book call for a Dutch oven, meaning a heavy-duty pot <br> with a 5- to 7-quart capacity and a lid. You can substitute a soup pot, stew pot, or any other vessel that comfortably holds the amount of chili you require, but to avoid burning, I recommend cast-iron, enamelware, or any heavy-duty pot made with multiple layers of metal, such as All-Clad. Most chilis &nbsp;do extremely well in the slow-cooker (see box on page 3).<br><br> <b>Ratio </b>The basic ratio of ingredients that go into a well-seasoned chili was established by spice manufacturer and chili pioneer William Gebhardt (see page 46). His formula calls for 2 pounds of meat to 1 ounce (4 tablespoons) of chili powder to 4 cups of liquid. Standard additions include garlic, onions, and canned tomatoes.<br><br> <b>Meats </b>Beef was central to the old-fashioned chilis of the nineteenth century; however, even in those days venison and bison were common alternatives. Turkey chile stew goes back to the pre-Columbian era. Pork and lamb are excellent modern choices. In other words, use what you have or what inspires you.<br><br> <b>Meat Prep </b>In the earliest days of chili, meats were chopped or minced by hand, but ground meats have become more typical and are certainly convenient. &#x201c;Chili grind&#x201d; is a term used by Texas butchers to describe meats that have been coarsely ground using a 1&#x2044;2-inch plate. It is ideal if you are looking for a more old-school texture but don&#x2019;t want to go to the trouble of hand-chopping your meat.<br><br> <b>Masa Harina </b>Masa harina is a powder that&#x2019;s used to make the dough for corn tortillas (page 25). It&#x2019;s also a favorite thickener in Texas-style chili con carne. The most common brand of masa harina in Mexico and the United States is Maseca; it&#x2019;s available in any grocery store that sells Mexican ingredients.<br><br> <b>Serving Size </b>For the recipes in this book, one serving of chili is a generous 1&#x2044;2 cup. Figure on using a 1&#x2044;4 cup if you want an appetizer-size serving.<br><br> <b>Leftovers and Storage </b>Store leftover chili in a covered container in the refrigerator; it will keep for up to 4 days. In fact, chili is reputed to get better after sitting in the fridge for awhile. Chili freezes very well and can be kept for up to 3&nbsp;months in the freezer. When preparing a large batch recipe, such as Homemade Coney Sauce (page 132), consider freezing the chili <br> in several containers so you can thaw only the amount required.<br><br><b>Chili in the Slow-Cooker</b><br>This icon has been added to recipes that do well in a slow-cooker.&nbsp;A long simmer time is ideal for many chilis and a 6-quart capacity slow-cooker will hold even the largest recipes in this book. If you want to cook chili all day while you are at work, just set the cooker on low&#x2014;the chili meat will be fine.<br><br> If the recipe has beans, though, make sure to add the beans later. Canned beans will turn to mush <br> if they cook too long. If you are cooking a chili that contains beans in an unattended slow-cooker, you will want to wait to add them 20 to 30 minutes before serving.&nbsp;Some of the chilis in this book aren&#x2019;t right for a slow-cooker, so look for the icon.</p><h2>Paris. Portrait of a City</h2><p><p>A city built on two millennia of history, Paris is entering the third century of its love story with photography.It was on the banks of the Seine that Ni�pce and Daguerre officially gave birth to this new art that has flourished ever since, developing a distinctive language and becoming a vital tool of knowledge.Paris: Portrait of a City leads us through what Goethe described as a &#x201c;universal city where every step upon a bridge or a square recalls a great past, where a fragment of history is unrolled at the corner of every street.&#x201d; The history of Paris is recounted in photographs ranging from Daguerre&#x2019;s early incunabula to the most recent images&#x2015;an almost complete record of over a century and a half of transformations and a vast panorama spanning more than 600 pages and 500 photographs.

While studying for her Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology, she developed an interest in hypnosis and learned to place herself in an altered state of consciousness for the purpose of stress management. In the early 1980s, Lyssa had a dream in which a spiritual entity appeared and told her that she would be a channel. Her self-hypnosis abilities helped her develop the necessary skills for her later development as a channel. In 1979 Lyssa and her family witnessed an extraordinary UFO sighting near their family home in New Hampshire. This experience triggered an acute interest in extraterrestrial phenomena that propelled her into an in-depth study of the nature of human and extraterrestrial consciousness through her channeling and intuitive abilities. Though she works frequently with extraterrestrial information, the practical application of what she teaches and channels is her highest priority. Lyssa Royal Holt has been using her channeling skills professionally since 1985 by channeling for thousands around the world. She has frequently appeared on national and international television, radio shows, and contributes to magazines such as the Sedona Journal of Emergence! Lyssa has conducted extensive seminar tours throughout the United States, Japan, South Africa, Germany, and Australia and continues to lead tour groups to such ancient power spots as the Yucatan, England, Egypt, Peru, and Easter Island. Lyssa is the author of several books published in seven languages: Millennium: Tools for the Coming Changes, Preparing for Contact, Visitors from Within, and The Prism of Lyra An Exploration of Human Galactic Heritage.

It&#x2019;s dangerously inspiring.&#x201d;&#x2014;A. J. Jacobs, author of <i>The Know-It-All </i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> When he set out to visit all of the planet&#x2019;s countries by age thirty-five, compulsive goal-seeker Chris Guillebeau never imagined that his journey&#x2019;s biggest revelation would be how <i>many </i>people like himself exist&#x2014;each pursuing a challenging quest. These quests are as diverse as humanity itself, involving exploration, the pursuit of athletic or artistic excellence, or battling against injustice and poverty. Everywhere that Chris visited he found ordinary people working toward extraordinary goals, making daily down payments on their dreams. These &#x201c;questers&#x201d; included a suburban mom pursuing a wildly ambitious culinary project, a DJ producing the world&#x2019;s largest symphony, a young widower completing the tasks his wife would never accomplish&#x2014;and scores of others writing themselves into the record books. <br> &nbsp;<br> The more Chris spoke with these strivers, the more he began to appreciate the direct link between questing and long-term happiness, and he was compelled to complete a comprehensive study of the phenomenon. In <i>The Happiness of Pursuit</i>, he draws on interviews with hundreds of questers, revealing their secret motivations, their selection criteria, the role played by friends and family, their tricks for solving logistics, and the importance of documentation. Equally fascinating is Chris&#x2019;s examination of questing&#x2019;s other side. What happens <i>after </i>the summit is climbed, the painting hung, the endurance record broken, the at-risk community saved?<br> &nbsp;<br> A book that challenges each of us to take control&#x2014;to make our lives be <i>about </i>something while at the same time remaining clear-eyed about the commitment&#x2014;<i>The Happiness of Pursuit </i>will inspire readers of every age and aspiration. It&#x2019;s a playbook for making your life count. <br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;<i>The Happiness of Pursuit</i> is smart, honest, and dangerous. Why dangerous? Because it is as practical as it is inspiring. You won&#x2019;t just be daydreaming about your quest&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll be packing for it!&#x201d;&#x2014;Bren� Brown, Ph.D., LMSW, author of <i>Daring Greatly</i></b></p><p><p><b>A Q&amp;A with Author Chris Guillebeau</b></p> <p><strong>What do you mean in your book by questing?</strong></p> <p>Questing refers to the pursuit of a long-term challenge or adventure with a series of intermediate steps. The &#x201c;questers&#x201d; I write about are focused on a specific goal, <i>often</i> to the exclusion of all others. They devote years toward the journey, inevitably finding themselves changed along the way.</p> <p><strong>What is a quest? Is it just a long trip or athletic pursuit?</strong></p> <p>A quest has a few specific characteristics: a clear goal, a real challenge, and a set of milestones along the way. Interestingly, while a quest is often an extended physical journey&#x2014;like visiting every country in the world or circumnavigating the oceans in a small sailboat&#x2014;there are many other kinds of quests as well. Over several years of research, I met activists, academics, artists, and others who chose to spend long amounts of time on something that mattered to them. I was interested in why they undertook such a mission, and what happened to them as they drew closer to their goal. </p> <p><strong>How long did it take to visit every country in the world? </strong></p> <p>Start to finish, it took eleven years. However, I didn&#x2019;t really begin the quest aspect of traveling until after I&#x2019;d been to the first forty or fifty countries. From there, I set a goal of visiting one-hundred countries. As I approached the first one-hundred, I decided to attempt the challenging of visiting <i>all</i> of them. This led to a five-year process of traveling 300,000+ miles a year, constantly learning about the world and figuring out logistics as I went along. I also visited many of the same countries over and over as I traveled to locations further afield. </p> <p><strong>How do questers decide on what to pursue and what to avoid? </strong></p> <p>If you&#x2019;re going to pursue a quest, you should choose something you&#x2019;re <i>really</i> excited about. My quest was to visit every country in the world, mostly because I loved travel and enjoyed combining it with the structure of goal-setting. Others focus on their own hobbies or passions, turning them into the long-term pursuits: to knit 10,000 hats, to walk across America, to become a real-life ninja, and so on.</p> <p>It also helps if there&#x2019;s a deeper purpose to your quest. Many of the people I talked to for the book felt a sense of calling or mission, even if they weren&#x2019;t religious. They were compelled; they simply <i>had</i> to pursue the quest. They knew if they didn&#x2019;t, they would always regret it. </p> <p><strong>What role do family and friends play in questers pursuing their dreams? </strong></p> <p>A complicated one. In many cases, family and friends provided critical support for the questers. In some cases, though, family and friends &#x201c;just didn&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d; In these cases it was usually important for the quester to establish an outside support group as they progressed along their way. </p> <p><strong>Is it important to document a quest? </strong></p> <p>One of the key themes of quests is that they must be measurable. They must have an end goal&#x2014;you have to be able to say, &#x201c;This is what I&#x2019;m working toward and I&#x2019;ll complete it when x happens.&#x201d; Documenting the steps along the way provides tremendous momentum, since you can see how far they&#x2019;ve come and how far still remains. </p> <p>In my case I used a Wikipedia article that contained a list of every country. I copied it into Evernote and whenever I visited a new country, I&#x2019;d place a big X beside it. As the years went by, the number of Xs grew until there were only a few places I hadn&#x2019;t visited. Finally, I was able to visit those places as well. Just having that file gave me a sense of urgency as I made my plans and set out on another Round-the-World trip or 30-hour series of flights. </p> <p><strong>What happens to someone after they&#x2019;ve completed the quest or achieved their goal? </strong></p> <p>Most of the time there's a feeling of accomplishment combined with a sense of melancholy or even alienation. Quests are complicated! Very often, much of the identity of the quester lies in the quest itself. The best path forward is usually to take some time to reflect on the journey. Then&#x2014;whenever the time is right&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll need a new quest. </p><b>Chris Guillebeau</b> is the author of&nbsp;<i>The Art of Non-Conformity, The $100 Startup, The Happiness of Pursuit, Born for This, Side Hustle, </i>and <i>100 Side Hustles</i>.

Within a ten-month period, Neil Peart suffered family losses so devastating that they left him a ghost &#x2014; physically a man but with nothing inside: no hope, meaning, faith, or desire to keep living. One year after the first tragedy, Neil was choosing between life and his own death. Finally, all he could decide was motion. He got on his BMW R1100GS motorcycle, and over the next 14 months, rode 55,000 miles, in search of a reason to live. On a journey of escape, exile, and exploration, he travelled from Quebec to Alaska, down the Canadian and American coasts and western regions, to Mexico and Belize, and finally back to Quebec. While riding "the Healing Road," Neil recorded in his journals his progress and setbacks in the grieving/healing process, and the pain of constantly reliving his losses. He also recorded with dazzling, colourful, entertaining, and moving artistry, the enormous range of his travel adventures, from the mountains to the sea, from the deserts to Arctic ice, and the dozens of memorable people, characters, friends, and relatives he met along the way, and who increasingly contributed to his healing and sense of meaning and purpose. He begins the journey with nothing, "the Ghost Rider." What he finally attains is joy, love, and indelible memories of the most extraordinary journey of his life. Ghost Rider is a bold, brilliantly written, intense, exciting, and ultimately triumphant narrative memoir from a gifted writer and musician, who started out as a man reduced to trying to stay alive by staying on the move. 2002 Drainie-Taylor Biography Prize finalist. Over 80,000 copies sold. Globe &amp; Mail and Amazon.com bestseller.</p></p><p>Neil Peart is the drummer for the rock band Rush and author of Masked Rider. He lives in Toronto, Canada.Outside the house by the lake the heavy rain seemed to hold down the darkness, grudging the slow fade from black, to blue, to gray. As I prepared that last breakfast at home, squeezing the oranges, boiling the eggs, smelling the toast and coffee, I looked out the kitchen window at the dim Quebec woods gradually coming into focus. Near the end of a wet summer, the spruce, birch, poplars, and cedars were densely green, glossy and dripping.<p></p><p>For this momentous departure I had hoped for a better omen than this cold, dark, rainy morning, but it did have a certain pathetic fallacy, a sympathy with my interior weather. In any case, the weather didn&#x2019;t matter; I was going. I still didn&#x2019;t know where (Alaska? Mexico? Patagonia?), or for how long (two months? four months? a year?), but I knew I had to go. My life depended on it.</p><p>Sipping the last cup of coffee, I wrestled into my leathers, pulled on my boots, then rinsed the cup in the sink and picked up the red helmet. I pushed it down over the thin balaclava, tightened the plastic rainsuit around my neck, and pulled on my thick waterproof gloves. I knew this was going to be a cold, wet ride, and if my brain wasn&#x2019;t ready for it, at least my body would be prepared. That much I could manage.</p><p>The house on the lake had been my sanctuary, the only place I still loved, the only thing I had left, and I was tearing myself away from it unwillingly, but desperately. I didn&#x2019;t expect to be back for a while, and one dark corner of my mind feared that I might <i>never</i> get back home again. This would be a perilous journey, and it might end badly. By this point in my life I knew that bad things could happen, even to me.</p><p>I had no definite plans, just a vague notion to head north along the Ottawa River, then turn west, maybe across Canada to Vancouver to visit my brother Danny and his family. Or, I might head northwest through the Yukon and Northwest Territories to Alaska, where I had never travelled, then catch the ferry down the coast of British Columbia toward Vancouver. Knowing that ferry would be booked up long in advance, it was the one reservation I had dared to make, and as I prepared to set out on that dark, rainy morning of August 20th, 1998, I had two and a half weeks to get to Haines, Alaska &#x2014; all the while knowing that it didn&#x2019;t really matter, to me or anyone else, if I kept that reservation.</p><p>Out in the driveway, the red motorcycle sat on its centerstand, beaded with raindrops and gleaming from my careful preparation. The motor was warming on fast idle, a plume of white vapor jetting out behind, its steady hum muffled by my earplugs and helmet.</p><p>I locked the door without looking back. Standing by the bike, I checked the load one more time, adjusting the rain covers and shock cords. The proverbial deep breath gave me the illusion of commitment, to the day and to the journey, and I put my left boot onto the footpeg, swung my right leg high over the heavily laden bike, and settled into the familiar saddle.</p><p>My well&#x2013;travelled BMW R1100GS (the &#x201c;adventure&#x2013;touring&#x201d; model) was packed with everything I might need for a trip of unknown duration, to unknown destinations. Two hard&#x2013;shell luggage cases flanked the rear wheel, while behind the saddle I had stacked a duffel bag, tent, sleeping bag, inflatable foam pad, groundsheet, tool kit, and a small red plastic gas can. I wanted to be prepared for anything, anywhere.</p><p>Because I sometimes liked to travel faster than the posted speed limits, especially on the wide open roads of the west &#x2014; where it was safe in terms of visible risks, but dangerous in terms of hidden enforcement &#x2014; I had decided to try using a small radar detector, which I tucked into my jacket pocket, with its earpiece inside the helmet.</p><p>A few other necessities, additional tools, and my little beltpack filled the tankbag in front of me, and a roadmap faced up from a clear plastic cover on top. The rest of the baggage I would carry away with me that morning had less bulk, but more weight &#x2014; the invisible burdens that had driven me to depart into what already seemed like a kind of exile.</p><p></p></p><h2>Landscape Pyrography Techniques &amp; Projects: A Beginner's Guide to Burning by Layer for Beautiful Results (Fox Chapel Publishing) Woodburning Textured, Lifelike Scenes in Layers, with Lora S.

Emma was barely able to decipher them&#x2014;the reception wasn&#x2019;t particularly good on the roof of the Sepulchre Bar. She paced along the edge of the roofline, peering down into the central courtyard. Jacaranda trees were strung with electric lights, and sleek ultramodern tables and chairs were scattered around the garden space. Equally sleek and ultramodern young men and women thronged the place, glasses of wine glimmering in their hands like clear bubbles of red and white and pink. Someone had rented out the place for a private party: A sequined birthday banner hung between two trees, and waiters made their way through the crowd carrying pewter chargers of snacks.<br> <br>There was something about the glamorous scene that made Emma want to break it up by kicking down some of the roof tiles or doing a front flip into the crowd. The Clave would lock you up for a good long time for that kind of behavior, though. Mundanes weren&#x2019;t supposed to ever glimpse Shadowhunters. Even if Emma did jump down into the courtyard, none of the partygoers would see her. She was covered in glamour runes, applied by Cristina, that rendered her invisible to anyone without the Sight.<br> <br>Emma sighed and put the phone back to her ear. &#x201c;All right, our relationship,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Our relationship isn&#x2019;t working out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Emma,&#x201d; Cristina hissed loudly behind her. Emma turned, her boots balanced at the edge of the roof. Cristina was sitting on the shingled slope behind her, polishing a throwing knife with a pale blue cloth. The cloth matched the bands that held her dark hair back from her face. Everything about Cristina was neat and put together&#x2014;she managed to look as professional in her black fighting gear as most people would look in a power suit. Her golden good-luck medallion glimmered at the hollow of her throat and her family ring, twined with a pattern of roses for Rosales, shone on her hand as she placed the knife, wrapped in its cloth, beside her. &#x201c;Emma, remember. Use your I statements.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cameron was still wittering away on the other end of the phone, something about getting together to talk, which Emma knew would be pointless. She focused on the scene below her&#x2014;was that a shadow slipping through the crowd below, or was she imagining it? Maybe it was wishful thinking. Johnny Rook was usually reliable, and he&#x2019;d seemed very sure about tonight, but Emma hated getting all geared up and full of anticipation only to discover there was going to be no fight to work off her energy.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is about me, not you,&#x201d; she said into the phone. Cristina gave her an encouraging thumbs-up. &#x201c;I am sick of you.&#x201d; She smiled brightly as Cristina dropped her face into her hands. &#x201c;So maybe we could go back to being friends?&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a click as Cameron hung up. Emma tucked the phone into her belt and scanned the crowd again. Nothing. Annoyed, she scrambled up the slope of the roof to flop down beside Cristina. &#x201c;Well, that could have gone better,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think so?&#x201d; Cristina took her hands away from her face. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Emma sighed and reached for her stele, the delicate adamas writing instrument Shadowhunters used to ink protection runes onto their skin. It had a carved handle made of demon bone and had been a gift from Jace Herondale, Emma&#x2019;s first crush. Most Shadowhunters went through steles like mundanes went through pencils, but this one was special to Emma and she kept it as carefully intact as she kept her sword. &#x201c;It always happens. Everything was fine, and then I woke up one morning and just the sound of his voice made me feel sick to my stomach.&#x201d; She looked at Cristina guiltily. &#x201c;I tried,&#x201d; she added. &#x201c;I waited weeks! I kept hoping it would get better. But it didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cristina patted her arm. &#x201c;I know, cuata,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You just aren&#x2019;t very good at having . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tact?&#x201d; Emma suggested. Cristina&#x2019;s English was nearly accentless, and Emma often forgot it wasn&#x2019;t her first language. On the other hand Cristina spoke seven languages on top of her native Spanish. Emma spoke English and some scraps of Spanish, Greek, and Latin, could read three demon languages, and swear in five.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was going to say relationships,&#x201d; Cristina said. Her dark brown eyes twinkled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve only been here for two months and you&#x2019;ve forgotten three dates with Cameron, skipped his birthday, and now you&#x2019;ve dumped him because it was a slow patrol night.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He always wanted to play video games,&#x201d; said Emma. &#x201c;I hate video games.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No one is perfect, Emma.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But some people are perfect for each other. Don&#x2019;t you think that has to be true?&#x201d;<br> <br>A strange look flashed over Cristina&#x2019;s face, gone so quickly Emma was sure she&#x2019;d imagined it. Sometimes Emma was reminded that however much she felt close to Cristina, she didn&#x2019;t know her&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t know her the way she did Jules, the way you knew someone whose every moment you had shared since you were children. What had happened to Cristina in Mexico&#x2014;whatever had sent her running to Los Angeles and away from her family and friends&#x2014;was something she&#x2019;d never spoken of to Emma.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said Cristina, &#x201c;at least you were wise enough to bring me along for moral support to help you through this difficult time.&#x201d;<br> <br>Emma poked Cristina with her stele. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t planning on dumping Cameron. We were here, and he called, and his face came up on my phone&#x2014;well, actually a llama came up on my phone because I didn&#x2019;t have a picture of him so I just used a llama&#x2014;and the llama made me so angry I just couldn&#x2019;t help myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bad time to be a llama.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is it ever a good time, really?&#x201d; Emma flipped the stele around and started to ink a Sure-Footedness rune onto her arm. She prided herself on having excellent balance without runes, but up on a roof it was probably a good idea to be safe.<br> <br>She thought of Julian, far away in England, with a sting at her heart. He would have been pleased she was being careful. He would have said something funny and loving and self-deprecating about it. She missed him horribly, but she supposed that was how it was when you were parabatai, bound together by magic as well as friendship.<br> <br>She missed all the Blackthorns. She had grown up playing among Julian and his sisters and brothers, lived with them since she was twelve&#x2014;when she had lost her parents, and Julian, whose mother had already died, had lost his father. From being an only child she had been thrust into a big, loud, noisy, loving family. Not every part of it had been easy, but she adored them, from shy Drusilla to Tiberius, who loved detective stories. They had left at the beginning of the summer to visit their great-aunt in Sussex&#x2014;the Blackthorn family was originally British. Marjorie, Julian had explained, was nearly a hundred years old and might die at any moment; they had to visit her. It was a moral requirement.<br> <br>Off they&#x2019;d gone for two months, all of them except their uncle, the head of the Institute. The shock to Emma&#x2019;s system had been severe. The Institute had gone from noisy to quiet. Worst of all, when Julian was gone, she felt it, like a constant unease, a low-level pain in her chest.<br> <br>Dating Cameron had not helped, but Cristina&#x2019;s arrival had helped immeasurably. It was common for Shadowhunters who reached the age of eighteen to visit foreign Institutes and learn their different customs. Cristina had come to Los Angeles from Mexico City&#x2014;there was nothing unusual about it, but she&#x2019;d always had the air of someone running from something. Emma, meanwhile, had been running from loneliness. She and Emma had run directly into each other, and become best friends faster than Emma could have believed possible.<br> <br>&#x201c;Diana will be pleased about you dumping Cameron, at least,&#x201d; said Cristina. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think she liked him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Diana Wrayburn was the Blackthorn family&#x2019;s tutor. She was extremely smart, extremely stern, and extremely tired of Emma falling asleep in the middle of class because she&#x2019;d been out the night before.<br> <br>&#x201c;Diana just thinks all relationships are a distraction from studying,&#x201d; Emma said. &#x201c;Why date when you can learn an extra demonic language? I mean, who wouldn&#x2019;t want to know how to say &#x2018;Come here often?&#x2019; in Purgatic?&#x201d;<br> <br>Cristina laughed. &#x201c;You sound like Jaime. He hated studying.&#x201d; Emma perked her ears: Cristina rarely spoke of the friends or family in Mexico City she&#x2019;d left behind. She knew Cristina&#x2019;s uncle had run the Mexico City Institute until he&#x2019;d been killed in the Dark War and her mother had taken it over. She knew Cristina&#x2019;s father had died when she was a child. But not much else. &#x201c;But not Diego. He loved it. He did extra work for fun.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Diego? The perfect guy? The one your mom loves?&#x201d; Emma began to trace the stele over her skin, the Farsighted rune taking shape on her forearm. The sleeves of her gear were elbow length, the skin below it marked all over with the pale white scars of runes long ago used up.<br> <br>Cristina reached over and took the stele from Emma. &#x201c;Here. Let me do that.&#x201d; She continued the Farsighted rune. Cristina had a gorgeous hand with runes, careful and precise. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to talk about Perfect Diego,&#x201d; Cristina said. &#x201c;My mother talks about him enough. Can I ask you about something else?&#x201d;<br> <br>Emma nodded. The pressure of the stele against her skin was familiar, almost pleasant.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know you wanted to come here because Johnny Rook told you that there have been bodies found with writing on them, and he thinks one will turn up here tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Correct.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you are hoping the writing will be the same as it was on your parents&#x2019; bodies.&#x201d;<br> <br>Emma tensed. She couldn&#x2019;t help it. Any mention of her parents&#x2019; murders hurt as if it had happened yesterday. Even when the person asking her about it was as gentle as Cristina. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Clave says Sebastian Morgenstern murdered your parents,&#x201d; said Cristina. &#x201c;That is what Diana told me. That&#x2019;s what they believe. But you don&#x2019;t believe it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Clave. Emma looked out into the Los Angeles night, at the brilliant explosion of electricity that was the skyline, at the rows and rows of billboards that lined Sunset Boulevard. It had been a harmless word, &#x201c;Clave,&#x201d; when she had first learned it. The Clave was simply the government of the Nephilim, made up of all active Shadowhunters over the age of eighteen.<br> <br>In theory every Shadowhunter had a vote and an equal voice. In point of fact, some Shadowhunters were more influential than others: Like any political party, the Clave had its corruption and prejudices. For Nephilim this meant a strict code of honor and rules that every Shadowhunter had to adhere to or face dire consequences.<br> <br>The Clave had a motto: The Law is hard, but it is the Law. Every Shadowhunter knew what it meant. The rules of the Law of the Clave had to be obeyed, no matter how hard or painful. The Law overrode everything else&#x2014;personal need, grief, loss, unfairness, treachery. When the Clave had told Emma that she was to accept the fact that her parents had been murdered as part of the Dark War, she had been required to do so.<br> <br>She hadn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Emma said slowly. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cristina sat with the stele motionless in her hand, the rune unfinished. The adamas gleamed in the moonlight. &#x201c;Could you tell me why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sebastian Morgenstern was building an army,&#x201d; Emma said, still looking out at the sea of lights. &#x201c;He took Shadowhunters and turned them into monsters that served him. He didn&#x2019;t mark them up with demon languages written on their bodies and then dump them in the ocean. When the Nephilim tried to move my parents&#x2019; bodies, they dissolved. That didn&#x2019;t happen to any of Sebastian&#x2019;s victims.&#x201d; She moved her finger along a roof tile. &#x201c;And&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a feeling. Not a passing feeling. Something I&#x2019;ve always believed. I believe it more every day. I believe my parents&#x2019; deaths were different. And that laying them at Sebastian&#x2019;s door means&#x2014;&#x201d; She broke off with a sigh. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;m just rambling. Look, this is probably going to be nothing. You shouldn&#x2019;t worry about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I worry about you,&#x201d; Cristina said, but she laid the stele back against Emma&#x2019;s skin and finished the rune without another word. It was something that Emma had liked about Cristina since the moment she&#x2019;d met her&#x2014;she never pressed or pressured.<br> <br>Emma glanced down in appreciation as Cristina sat back, done with her work. The Farsighted rune gleamed clear and clean on Emma&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;The only person I know who draws better runes than you do is Julian,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But he&#x2019;s an artist&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Julian, Julian, Julian,&#x201d; echoed Cristina in a teasing voice. &#x201c;Julian is a painter, Julian is a genius, Julian would know how to fix this, Julian could build that. You know, for the past seven weeks I&#x2019;ve heard so many wonderful things about Julian I&#x2019;m starting to worry that when I meet him I will fall in love with him instantly.&#x201d;<br> <br>Emma brushed her gritty hands carefully down her legs. She felt tight and itchy and tense. All wound up for a battle and no fighting, she told herself. No wonder she wanted to jump out of her skin. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s your type,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But he&#x2019;s my parabatai, so I&#x2019;m not objective.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cristina handed Emma&#x2019;s stele back to her. &#x201c;I always wanted a parabatai,&#x201d; she said a little wistfully. &#x201c;Someone who is sworn to protect you and to watch your back. A best friend forever, for your whole life.&#x201d;<br> <br>A best friend forever, for your whole life. When Emma&#x2019;s parents had died, she&#x2019;d fought to stay with the Blackthorns. Partly because she&#x2019;d lost everything familiar to her and she couldn&#x2019;t bear the thought of starting over, and partly because she&#x2019;d wanted to stay in Los Angeles so that she could investigate her parents&#x2019; deaths.<br> <br>It might have been awkward; she might have felt, the only Carstairs in a house of Blackthorns, out of place in the family. But she never had, because of Jules. Parabatai was more than friendship, more than family; it was a bond that tied you together, fiercely, in a way that every Shadowhunter respected and acknowledged the way that they respected the bond between husband and wife.<br> <br>No one would separate parabatai. No one would dare try: Parabatai were stronger together. They fought together as if they could read each other&#x2019;s minds. A single rune given to you by your parabatai was more powerful than ten runes given to you by someone else. Often parabatai had their ashes buried in the same tomb so that they wouldn&#x2019;t be parted, even in death.<br> <br>Not everyone had a parabatai; in fact, they were rare. It was a lifelong, binding commitment. You were swearing to stay by the other person&#x2019;s side, swearing to always protect them, to go where they went, to consider their family your family. The words of the oath were from the Bible, and ancient: Whither thou goest, I will go; thy �people shall be my people; where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried.<br> <br>If there was a term for it in mundane English, Emma thought, it would have been &#x201c;soul mate.&#x201d; Platonic soul mate. You weren&#x2019;t allowed to be romantically involved with your parabatai. Like so many things, it was against the Law. Emma had never known why&#x2014;it didn&#x2019;t make any sense&#x2014;but then, much of the Law didn&#x2019;t. It hadn&#x2019;t made sense for the Clave to exile and abandon Julian&#x2019;s half siblings, Helen and Mark, simply because their mother had been a faerie, but they&#x2019;d done that too when they&#x2019;d created the Cold Peace.<br> <br>Emma stood up, sliding her stele into her weapons belt. &#x201c;...</p><h2>Decameron Tarot (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p><p>This deck, created by celebrated Italian illustrator Gaudenzi and scholar of erotic culture Spadanuda, bravely plumbs the earthy world of Boccaccio's Decameron.

"And to think I bought you that dopey crocheted rug you tripped on," she said.</p> <p>"You only bought it. I caught my heel in it," the well-known mystery writer said wanly. "It wasn't your fault I was wearing those idiotic stilts."</p> <p>Nora attempted to shift her body, which was anchored by a heavy plaster cast that reached from her toes to her thigh.</p> <p>"I'll leave you two to assess the blame for the broken leg," Luke Reilly, owner of three funeral homes, husband and father, observed as he hoisted his long, lean body from the low bedside armchair. "I've got a funeral to go to, a dentist's appointment, and then, since our Christmas plans are somewhat altered, I guess I'd better see about buying a tree."</p> <p>He bent over and kissed his wife. "Look at it this way: you may not be gazing at the Pacific Ocean, but you've got a good view of the East River." He and Nora and their only child, thirty-one-year-old Regan, had been planning to spend the Christmas holiday on Maui.</p> <p>"You're a scream," Nora told him. "Dare we hope you'll arrive home with a tree that isn't your usual Charlie Brown special?"</p> <p>"That's not nice," Luke protested.</p> <p>"But it's true." Nora dismissed the subject. "Luke, you look exhausted. Can't you skip Goodloe's funeral? Austin can take care of everything."</p> <p>Austin Grady was Luke's right-hand man. He had handled hundreds of funerals on his own, but the one today was different. The deceased, Cuthbert Boniface Goodloe, had left the bulk of his estate to the Seed-Plant-Bloom-and-Blossom Society of the Garden State of New Jersey. His disgruntled nephew and partial namesake, Cuthbert Boniface Dingle, known as C.B., was obviously bitter about his meager inheritance. After viewing hours yesterday afternoon, C.B. had sneaked back to the casket where Luke had found him stuffing rotted bits of house plants in the sleeves of the pin-striped designer suit the fastidious Goodloe had chosen as his last outfit.</p> <p>As Luke came up behind C.B., he heard him whispering, "You love plants? I'll give you plants, you senile old hypocrite. Get a whiff of these! Enjoy them from now until Resurrection Day!"</p> <p>Luke had backed away, not wanting to confront C.B., who continued to vent verbal outrage at the body of his less-than-generous uncle. It was not the first time Luke had heard a mourner telling off the deceased, but the use of decaying foliage was a first. Later, Luke had quietly removed the offensive vegetation. But today, he wanted to keep an eye on C.B. himself. Besides, he hadn't had a chance to mention the incident to Austin.</p> <p>Luke considered telling Nora about the nephew's bizarre behavior, but then decided not to go into it. "Goodloe's been planning his own funeral with me for three years," he said instead. "If I didn't show up, he'd haunt me."</p> <p>"I suppose you should go." Nora's voice was sleepy, and her eyes were starting to close. "Regan, why don't you let Dad drop you off at the apartment? The last painkiller they gave me is knocking me out."</p> <p>"I'd rather hang around until your private nurse gets here," Regan said. "I want to make sure someone is with you."</p> <p>"All right. But then go to the apartment and crash. You know you never sleep on the red-eye flight."</p> <p>Regan, a private investigator who lived in Los Angeles, had been packing for the trip to Hawaii when her father phoned.</p> <p>"Your mother's fine," he began. "But she's had an accident. She broke her leg."</p> <p>"She broke her leg?" Regan had repeated.</p> <p>"Yes. We were on our way to a black tie at the Plaza. Mom was one of the honorees. She was running a little late. I rang for the elevator..."</p> <p>One of Dad's not very subtle ways of getting Mom to hurry up, Regan thought.</p> <p>"The elevator arrived, but she didn't. I went back into the apartment and found her lying on the floor with her leg at a very peculiar angle. But you know your mother. Her first question was to ask if her gown was torn."</p> <p>That would be Mom, Regan had thought affectionately.</p> <p>"She was the best-dressed emergency-room patient in the history of the hospital," Luke had concluded.</p> <p>Regan had dumped her Hawaii clothes out of the suitcase and replaced them with winter clothes suitable for New York. She barely made the last night flight from Los Angeles to Kennedy, and once in New York had paused only long enough to drop off her bags at her parents' apartment on Central Park South.</p> <p>From the doorway of the hospital room, Luke looked back and smiled at the sight of the two women in his life, so alike in some ways with their classic features, blue eyes, and fair skin, but so different in others. From the Black Irish Reillys, Regan had inherited raven black hair, a throwback to the Spaniards who had settled in Ireland after their Armada had been destroyed in battle with the British. Nora, however, was a natural blonde, and at five feet three inches was four inches shorter than her daughter. At six feet five, Luke towered over both of them. His once-dark hair was now almost completely silver.</p> <p>"Regan, I'll meet you back here at around seven," he said. "After we cheer your mother up, we'll go out and have a good dinner."</p> <p>He caught Nora's expression and smiled at her. "You thrive on the urge to kill, honey. All the reviewers say so." He waved his hand. "See you girls tonight."</p> <p>It was a commitment Luke would not be able to keep.</p> <p>Across town, apartment 16B at 211 Central Park South was in the process of being decorated for Christmas. "Deck the halls with boughs of holly," Alvirah Meehan sang, off-key, as she placed a miniature wreath around the framed picture of Willy and herself accepting the $40 million lottery check that had changed their lives forever.</p> <p>The picture brought back vividly that magical evening three years ago, when she'd been sitting in their tiny living room in Flushing, Queens, and Willy had been half asleep in his old club chair. She had been soaking her feet in a pail of warm water after a hard day of cleaning Mrs. O'Keefe's house when Willy came home, really bushed, from repairing a burst pipe that had sent showers of rusty water on the newly pressed clothes at Spot-Free Dry Cleaners down the block. Then the announcer on television began to read the winning lottery numbers.</p> <p>I sure look different now, Alvirah thought, shaking her head as she examined the picture. The brassy red hair that for so many years she had dyed herself in the bathroom sink had been transformed by Madame Judith, to a soft golden red with subtle shadings. The purple polyester pants suit had long ago been banished by her classy friend, Baroness Min Von Schreiber. Of course, her jutting jaw was the same, a product of God's design when he molded her, but she'd gotten down from a size sixteen to a trimmer size fourteen. There was no question about it -- she looked ten years younger and a thousand times better now than in the old days.</p> <p>I was sixty then and looked like I was pushing seventy. Now I'm sixty-three and don't look a day over fifty-nine, she told herself happily. On the other hand, she decided, looking at the picture, even dressed in that bargain-basement blue suit and skinny little tie, Willy managed to look handsome and distinguished. With his shock of white hair and vivid blue eyes, Willy always reminded people of the late, legendary Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tip O'Neill.</p> <p>Poor Willy, she sighed. What bad luck that he feels so rotten. Nobody should be stuck with a toothache during the Christmas season. But Dr. Jay will fix him up. Our big mistake was to get involved with that other guy when Dr. Jay moved to New Jersey, Alvirah thought. He talked Willy into getting a dental implant even though it hadn't worked last time, and it's been killing him. Oh, well, it could be worse, she reminded herself. Look what happened to Nora Regan Reilly.</p> <p>She had heard on the radio that the suspense author, who happened to be her favorite writer, had broken her leg the evening before in her apartment in the very next building. Her high heel had caught in the fringe of a rug, Alvirah mused -- the same kind of thing that happened to Grandma. But Grandma wasn't wearing high heels. She had stepped on a wad of bubble gum in the street, and when the fringe of the rug stuck to the bottom of her orthopedic sneakers, she went sprawling.</p> <p>"Hi, honey." Willy was coming down the hall from the bedroom. The right side of his face was swollen, and his expression was instant testimony to the fact that the troublesome implant was still killing him.</p> <p>Alvirah knew how to cheer him up. "Willy, you know what makes me feel good?"</p> <p>"Whatever it is, share it right away."</p> <p>"It's knowing that Dr. Jay will get rid of that implant, and by tonight you'll be feeling much better. I mean, aren't you better off than poor Nora Regan Reilly, who'll be hobbling around on crutches for weeks?"</p> <p>Willy shook his head and managed a smile. "Alvirah, can I never have an ache or a pain without you telling me how lucky I am? If I came down with the bubonic plague, you'd try to make me feel sorry for somebody else."</p> <p>Alvirah laughed. "I suppose I would at that," she agreed.</p> <p>"When you ordered the car, did you allow for holiday traffic? I never thought I'd be worried about missing a dentist appointment, but today I am."</p> <p>"Of course I did," she assured him. "We'll be there long before three. Dr. Jay squeezed you in before he sees his last patient. He's closing early for the holiday weekend."</p> <p>Willy looked at his watch. "It's only a little after ten. I wish he could see me this minute. What time is the car coming?"</p> <p>"One-thirty."</p> <p>"I'll start to get ready."</p> <p>With a sympathetic shake of her head, Alvirah watched her husband of forty-three years disappear back into the bedroom. He'll be feeling a thousand percent better tonight, she decided. I'll make some nice vegetable soup for dinner, and we'll watch the tape of <i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i> I'm glad we delayed our cruise until February. It will be good to have a quiet, at-home Christmas this year.</p> <p>A...</p></p><h2>Biblical Manhood: Masculinity, Leadership and Decision Making</h2><p>How does a man know if he is a real man?

But when Ray arrives the judge is already dead, and the one-page document dividing his meager estate between the two sons seems crystal clear. What it doesn't mention, however, is the small fortune in cash Ray discovers hidden in the old man's house--$3 million he can't account for and doesn't mention to brother Forrest, either.<p> Ray's efforts to keep his find a secret, figure out where it came from, and hide it from a nameless extortioner, who seems to know more about it than he does, culminate in a denouement with an almost biblical twist. It's a slender plot to hang a thriller on, and in truth it's not John Grisham's best in terms of pacing, dramatic tension, and interesting characters (except for Harry Rex, a country lawyer who was the judge's closest friend and in many ways is the father Ray wishes he'd had. He's so vivid he jumps off the page). But Grisham's legions of fans are likely to enjoy <i>The Summons</i> even if it lacks the power of some of his classic earlier books, like <i>The Firm</i>, <i>The Brethren</i>, and <i>The Testament</i>. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Ray Atlee is a professor of law at the University of Virginia.

It assumes<br>no prior understanding of what that means, nor does it assume that the person has actually come to<br>the point of professing faith. It uses as a starting point someone who is simply wondering, "What next?"<br><br>Stephen also addresses those who have grown up Christian and may be wondering how to step out in their own faith.<br><br><i>The Walk</i> is designed to be used as much as read. It will be helpful to someone who wants to read on his<br>own, but also includes readings and projects that will make it useful as a workbook for that individual, in a<br>mentor relationship, or for use in groups. <br><br>The division into twelve chapters is ideal for a typical Sunday School quarter.</p><p><b>Stephen Smallman</b> served for over forty years in pastoral ministry. He is an urban missionary serving with CityNet Ministries."This is the fruit of a lifetime of experience in ministry. I recommend<br>this warm, practical, gospel-centered and very useful manual on<br>discipleship." --<b>Tim Keller</b><br><br>"Stephen Smallman has given us a great gift with this book. It's now the first resource I'd recommend for disciples wanting to make disciples (which should be all of us)." --<b>Justin Taylor</b><br><br>"Lots of people have a heart for discipleship, but few have the ability to apply the gospel to a person s spiritual journey (seeker and believer alike) with the compassion and wisdom of Steve Smallman. His heart for God and for people energizes his ministry and this book." --<b>Ron Lutz</b></p><h2>The Deeper Journey: The Spirituality of Discovering Your True Self (Transforming Resources)</h2><p>As you journey deeper in the Christian pilgrimage, you come to realize that the Christian life is more than merely replicating particular spiritual disciplines or practices. You begin to understand that at the core of Christian faith is the transformation of your very identity. M. Robert Mulholland Jr. exposes the false selves that you may be tempted to hide behind and helps you to instead discover the true self that comes from being hidden with Christ in God. If the goal of the Christian journey is Christlikeness, then you must reckon with the unhealthy ways that you root your sense of being in things other than God. Along the way, you will discover a growing sense of intimacy and abandonment to God. Not only will you encounter the joy of discovering your own self, you will also find a greater love for others and compassion for the world. The expanded edition includes a study guide for individual reflection or group discussion.</p><p>"Robert Mulholland has gone deeper on the journey and now we can too. This will benefit all who want to follow Jesus' way." &#x2014;John Ortberg, Teaching Pastor, Menlo Park Presbyterian Church <p>"What a wonderfully mending and unsettling read. I read it and started reading it all over again. Mulholland serves as an experienced guide to what it means to have an inner life, a life that is 'hidden with Christ in God.' His voice helps me attend to the well-defended and self-referenced way I do life--even my spiritual life. The Deeper Journey is rich with the practical implications of what it means to be 'in God for the world.'" &#x2014;Adele Calhoun, author of Spiritual Disciplines Handbook </p><p>"Carrying the journey beyond that introduced in his earlier much-appreciated Invitation to a Journey, this new book by Robert Mulholland will be very helpful to all those who feel called to a deeper journey and who wonder how concepts such as the true and false self relate to biblical teaching. If this is you, read on and be prepared to meet God and yourself more deeply." &#x2014;David G. Benner, Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Spirituality, Psychological Studies Institute, and author of The Gift of Being Yourself </p><p>"Mulholland recommends radical honesty about ourselves as an essential part of the foundation of a deeper faith. We Christians in North America definitely need to ponder his conviction that the false self and the religious false self will lead us on dead-end roads. I found Mulholland's invitation to a deeper journey in Christ to be profoundly challenging and winsomely encouraging." &#x2014;Lynne M. Baab, author of Sabbath Keeping and Beating Burnout in Congregations </p><p>"Dr. Mulholland's exposition of the transforming journey from the noxious web of the false self to the liberating reality of the true self is totally compelling and a must read for disciples serious about the 'with-God' life." &#x2014;Bruce Demarest, Professor of Christian Formation, Denver Seminary </p><p>"Most of us are aware that there is something that is not quite right within us. When we are honest, we might even admit that there is something terribly wrong. It is called the false self. The Deeper Journey provides understanding and guidance for the journey from the false self to the true self. It is a harrowing journey, to be sure, but it is also a journey of hope and healing and freedom. This book is full of much-needed wisdom from one of the most trusted spiritual guides of our time." &#x2014;Ruth Haley Barton, cofounder of the Transforming Center, and author of Sacred Rhythms and Invitation to Solitude and Silence</p>M.

Martin Luther King found moral courage while sitting alone at his kitchen table one night during the Montgomery bus boycott. Jane Goodall used her intuition in the jungles of central Africa while learning how to approach chimps. Solitude is a state of mind, a space where you can focus on your own thoughts without distraction, with a power to bring mind and soul together in clear-eyed conviction. But these days, handheld devices and other media leave us awash with the thoughts of others. We are losing solitude without even realizing it.</p><p>To find solitude today, a leader must make a conscious effort. This book explains why the effort is worthwhile and how to make it. Through gripping historical accounts and firsthand interviews with a wide range of contemporary leaders, Raymond Kethledge (a federal court of appeals judge) and Michael Erwin (a West Pointer and three-tour combat veteran) show how solitude can enhance clarity, spur creativity, sustain emotional balance, and generate the moral courage necessary to overcome adversity and criticism. Anyone who leads anyone--including oneself--can benefit from solitude. With a foreword by Jim Collins (author of the bestseller <i>Good to Great</i>), <i>Lead Yourself First </i>is a rallying cry to reclaim solitude--and all the benefits, both practical and sublime, that come with it.</p></p><p><p><b>Raymond M. Kethledge </b>is a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and was a candidate for the Supreme Court in 2018. He formerly served as a law clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy and founded his own law firm. He lives near Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p><p><b>Michael S. Erwin </b>is a graduate of West Point and served three tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. He is now the CEO of the Character &amp; Leadership Center, the president of the Positivity Project, and the founder and chairman of Team Red, White &amp; Blue. He lives in North Carolina.</p><p>&#x201c;A thoughtful new book <i>Lead Yourself First</i> . . . tells the stories of many inspiring leaders throughout history who relied on solitude at crucial moments in their lives, from Winston Churchill and Pope John Paul II to Martin Luther King Jr. and Aung San Suu Kyi . . . But as the authors point out, you don't have to lead armies, corporations, or artistic movements to benefit from solitude.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Lead Yourself First</i> makes a compelling argument for the integral relationship between solitude and leadership.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;This thoughtful self-improvement guide from Kethledge, a Sixth Circuit judge, and Erwin, founder of the nonprofit Positivity Project, is a must-read for leaders who take their leadership roles seriously.

He&#x2019;s helped countless harried leaders &#x2014; like me! &#x2014; drink from the life-giving waters of Jesus.&#x201d; Larry Winger, CEO of Provision Ministries&#x201c;I took my pastoral staff and elders through Easy Yoke.&#x201d; Steve Phillips, Lead Pastor of The Journey Church</p><p>My inspiration to write this book came from a lunch meeting I had with Dallas Willard. He asked me, "If you had only one word to describe Jesus what would it be?"<br>"Love... Holy... Lord..."<br>Dallas told me that his word for Jesus was "Relaxed."<br>That's what I needed! I wasn't very relaxed in my life and ministry! So I began to study, meditate, and practice being in Jesus' easy yoke -- his rhythms of grace -- and I was amazed to see how I grew in God's peace and power.<br>For over ten years I've been sharing this with family and friends, pastors and leaders, and all kinds of people. We're all experiencing our best life is in Jesus' easy yoke!(See the &#34;Product Description&#34; above.)</p><h2>The Art of War: Illustrated Edition</h2><p>&nbsp;"Know the enemy and know yourself; in a hundred battles you will never be in peril." <i>The Art of War</i>, by the Chinese general and philosopher Sun Tzu, is one of the most influential books of military strategy ever written. More than 2,000 years old, this classic of Chinese philosophy lays out a systematic, rational approach to tactics and strategy that leaders worldwide have applied not only to the military, but also to business, law, martial arts, and sports. This elegant hardcover gift edition uses Lionel Giles's classic translation and stands apart for its gorgeous design, fine Chinese illustrations, and affordable price. Giles's extensive annotations and commentary on Sun Tzu's aphorisms and proverbs are also included.</p><p><i>The Art of War</i> is the Swiss army knife of military theory--pop out a different tool for any situation. Folded into this small package are compact views on resourcefulness, momentum, cunning, the profit motive, flexibility, integrity, secrecy, speed, positioning, surprise, deception, manipulation, responsibility, and practicality. Thomas Cleary's translation keeps the package tight, with crisp language and short sections. Commentaries from the Chinese tradition trail Sun-tzu's words, elaborating and picking up on puzzling lines. Take the solitary passage: "Do not eat food for their soldiers." Elsewhere, Sun-tzu has told us to plunder the enemy's stores, but now we're not supposed to eat the food? The Tang dynasty commentator Du Mu solves the puzzle nicely, "If the enemy suddenly abandons their food supplies, they should be tested first before eating, lest they be poisoned." Most passages, however, are the pinnacle of succinct clarity: "Lure them in with the prospect of gain, take them by confusion" or "Invincibility is in oneself, vulnerability is in the opponent." Sun-tzu's maxims are widely applicable beyond the military because they speak directly to the exigencies of survival. Your new tools will serve you well, but don't flaunt them. Remember Sun-tzu's advice: "Though effective, appear to be ineffective." <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Here is a seminal work on the philosophy of successful leadership that is as applicable to contemporary business as it is to war. James Clavell has taken a 1910 translation and clarified it for the contemporary reader.</p><h2>Bungo Stray Dogs, Vol. 6 (Bungo Stray Dogs, 6)</h2><p>As Ryuunousuke Akutagawa and Nathaniel Hawthorne engage in a life-or-death battle, Chuuya Nakahara has information about The Guild's plot to destroy the Armed Detective Agency.

Chester Raccoon has a baby brother&#x2015;and the baby brother is taking over his territory. When Chester sees his mother give his baby brother a Kissing Hand&#x2015;his Kissing Hand&#x2015;he is overcome with sadness, but Mrs. Raccoon soothes his fears with her own special brand of wisdom, finding just the right way to let Chester know he is deeply loved. Brought to life by Barbara Leonard Gibson's warm illustrations, this story is perfect for families who are adjusting to all the changes new members can bring.</p><p>PreS-Gr. 2. <i>The Kissing Hand</i> (1995), though too sweet for many tastes, has developed such a following that many libraries cannot fill the demand each year before the start of school. This sequel is also quite sweet, but those who love the original may want to read the new story about Chester Raccoon. Now beyond his kindergarten separation anxiety, Chester has a new problem: dealing with his younger brother, who plays with his toys, pulls his tail, follows him around, and even shares his mother's gift of a "Kissing Hand" (Mom kisses Chester's palm, and Chester can transfer the kiss to his cheek whenever he needs comfort). Chester's mother reassures him that she will never run out of Kissing Hands. In fact, she has a spare for Chester to give his brother when he needs a big brother's care. Teeming with details, Gibson's paintings depict an idyllic woodland populated with friendly beasts, birds, and bugs that seem to pause and take an interest in the raccoons' conversations. The focus of the artwork, as well as the story, is clearly on the loving mother-and-child relationship. Recommended for libraries in which the earlier book has a following. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>PreSchool-Grade 1 - A sequel to Penn's <i>The Kissing Hand</i> (CWLA, 1993). A young raccoon pleads with his mother to "return" his baby brother due to typical sibling offenses. When Chester sees her give little Ronny a "Kissing Hand" (a kiss in the middle of his open palm), the waterworks begin. Of course, Mrs. Raccoon reassures her older son of his continuing importance to her, adding a bonus Kissing Hand for being a big brother. The animals' emotions are clearly expressed in the narrative. Gibson's crisp, realistic paintings are colorful and depict the scenery and activity of the meadow. Although this book is more appealing than the first work, standbys like Ann Herbert Scott's <i>On Mother's Lap</i> (Clarion, 1992) or Kady MacDonald Denton's <i>Would They Love a Lion? </i>(Larousse, 1998) are still better choices.<i> - Gay Lynn Van Vleck, Henrico County Library, Glen Allen, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 1896, he began working for the London publisher, Redway, and also T. Fisher Unwin as a reader where he remained until 1902. During this time he undertook his first freelance journalistic assignments writing art and literary reviews. He also contributed regular columns to two newspapers: the Speaker (along with his friend Hilaire Belloc) and the Daily News. Throughout his life he contibuted further articles to journals, particularly The Bookman and The Illustrated London News. His first two books were published; two poetry collections, in 1900. These were followed by collections of essays and in 1903 by his most substantial work to that point; a study of Robert Browning. Chesterton&#39;s first novel, &#39;The Napoleon of Notting Hill&#39; was published in 1904. In this book he developed his political attitudes in which he attacked socialism, big business and technology and showed how they become the enemies of freedom and justice. These were themes which were to run throughout his other works. &#39;The Man who was Thursday&#39; was published in 1908 and is perhaps the novel most difficult to understand, although it is also his most popular. &#39;The Ball and the Cross&#39; followed in 1910 and &#39;Manalive&#39; in 1912. Chesterton&#39;s best-known fictional character appears in the Father Brown stories, the first of the collection, &#39;The Innocence of Father Brown&#39;, being published in 1911. Brown is a modest Catholic priest who uses careful psychology to put himself in the place of the criminal in order to solve the crime. His output was prolific, with a great variety of books from brilliant studies of Dickens, Shaw, and RL Stevenson to literary criticism. He also produced more poetry and many volumes of political, social and religious essays. Tremendous zest and energy, with a mastery of paradox, puns, a robust humour and forthright devotion along with great intelligence characterise his entire output. In the years prior to 1914 his fame was at its height, being something of a celebrity and seen as a latter day Dr Johnson as he frequented the pubs and offices of Fleet Street. His huge figure was encased in a cloak and wide brimmed hat, with pockets full of papers and proofs. Chesterton came from a nominlly Anglican family and had been baptized into the Church of England. However, he had no particular Christian belief and was in fact agnostic for a time. Nevertheless, in his late</p><h2>The Wampanoag (A True Book: American Indians) (A True Book (Relaunch))</h2><p><b>Explore the Wampanoag Indians, the nation's relationship with settlers, culture, women, housing, and more.</b><br><br>A True Book: American Indian series allows readers to experience what makes each American Indian people distinctive and exceptional.

When she finished writing The Toddler&#39;s Handbook her oldest son was 18 months old, and she had newborn twins. Following the successful launch of her first book, Dayna began work on The Baby&#39;s Handbook, The Preschooler&#39;s Handbook, and The Kindergartener&#39;s Handbook. The ideas in her books were inspired by her search to find better ways to teach her children. The concepts were vetted by numerous educators in different grade levels. Dayna is a stay-at-home mom, and is passionate about teaching her children in innovative ways. Her experiences have inspired her to create resources to help other families. With thousands of copies sold, her books have already become a staple learning source for many children around the world.<p>The reason I like this book is because it provides a range of useful concepts and words in a single volume. There are many ranges of flash cards which allow you to explore similar concepts with your child, but they&#x2019;re not nearly as portable and handy as having them all within the pages of a book. This also makes it easier to pull it out and work on these concepts with your child whenever you have a few minutes free. It also makes it easier to allow your child to explore these concepts and the pictures that represent them on their own (while you can do this with flash cards they will end up everywhere!). Probably the most beneficial way to use this book is to sit down with your child and let them decide which set of words, or concepts they&#x2019;d like to read at that particular time. This will not only ensure that they have fun while learning, but also that they remain focused for longer periods of time. However, remember that you should aim to keep any learning sessions short enough that your child doesn&#x2019;t become bored, and as a general rule of thumb, for any one session, aim to work on these concepts for one minute for each year in your child&#x2019;s age before taking a break.</p><p><strong>Colin M.

This cat's-eye view introduces the Holocaust to children in a gentle way that can open discussion of this period.</p></p><p><p>Josee Bisaillon grew up in St. Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada. Her illustrations are a mixture of collage, drawings, and digital montage, taking us into a richly detailed and multidimensional world.</p><p>"Through the eyes of an orange and white cat, readers are introduced to the harrowing event known as Kristallnacht. Benno spends his days observing the friendly, predictable rituals in his neighborhood: girls walking together to school, shopkeepers selling their wares, a Jewish family eating Sabbath dinner, a Christian family eating Sunday lunch. Then one night, he sees brown-shirted men breaking down doors, smashing shop windows, and setting fire to books and buildings. Jewish families disappear, and even though the people that remain resume their normal activities, nothing is ever quite the same again. The straightforward text describes events without sentimentality, as if Benno were simply reporting what he sees and hears. 'In Apartment 3B, the mob was breaking the Adlers' furniture and throwing books out the window. . . . The Schmidts' apartment was untouched.' But <strong>what truly distinguishes this book is the striking multimedia artwork composed of paper, fabric, and drawn images in hues of olive, brown, and red. Interesting angles, textures, and patterns add to the visual effect throughout.</strong> The spreads depict a normal city neighborhood from a cat's-eye view, which is eventually upended by dark shadowy figures with big black boots. Thus <strong>the message of terror and sadness that marks the beginning of the Holocaust is transmitted in a way that is both meaningful and comprehensible.</strong> An afterword provides historical context for the story, although it presupposes knowledge of the term 'Holocaust.' Use this book with Karen <em>Hesse's The Cats in Krasinski Square</em> (Scholastic, 2004) for further discussion of the topic. For all collections."<br>--<em>School Library Journal</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"<strong>It is not easy to tell young kids the horrifying truth about the Holocaust, but this picture book is a good place to start.</strong> Using the fictionalized viewpoint of a cat, Benno, it shows what happened to families in one Berlin community. Benno feels welcome in many homes and stores, and he likes following a Jewish girl, Sophie, and her Christian friend to school everyday. Then everything changes, and the neighborhood is no longer friendly. Benno cowers as terrifying men in brown shirts light bonfires, and then there is a night 'like no other,' during which Benno hears screams and shattering glass, and he watches apartments being ravaged and the synagogue burn. The next day, life continues for some, but Benno never sees others again, including Sophie and her family. The unframed, double-page spreads, created with a mix of collage, drawings, and digital montage, show the warm neighborhood transformed as red flames take over, books fly, and soldiers march in black boots with razor-edged soles. A brief afterword and bibliography add more information and historical context."<br>--<em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>Veterans: Heroes in Our Neighborhood</h2><p>Veterans: Heroes in Our Neighborhood is an engaging rhyming picture book for readers of all ages that fosters mindfulness of and appreciation for the brave service men and women who are also our family, friends, and neighbors.&nbsp; These are the men and women who bravely served our great country and now humbly serve in our communities.&nbsp;</p><p>Few of us will ever witness an act of valor, yet we walk among heroes who perform them every day--not in military uniform or wearing their medals, but while serving our communities as teachers, firefighters, mail carriers. Veterans are our neighbors, family, and friends. Although humble, these heroes deserve our appreciation for their service to our country.

The question you&#x2019;re facing is, &#x201c;How do we make our voices heard and bring in the needed support?&#x201d; </p><p> Here, you&#x2019;ll find plain-English answers. Featuring advice and stories from over 50 experienced fundraisers, foundation staffers, journalists and more, this book explains how to: </p><p></p><ul> <li> make a fundraising plan </li><li> work with individual donors </li><li> keep givers giving </li><li> plan special events </li><li> solicit grants from foundations and corporations </li><li> use traditional and social media to engage supporters </li><li> start a side business to raise funds </li><li> and much more. </li></ul><p> <i>Effective Fundraising for Nonprofits</i> also provides creative grassroots strategies and dozens of real-life success stories. Best of all, it cuts out the jargon and &#x201c;consultant speak&#x201d; that&#x2019;s all too common in nonprofit books. </p><p> The 6th edition is completely updated with new stories and samples, the latest IRS rules and regulations, and the latest communication strategies.</p></p><p>Written specially for new or grassroots organizations, this book is packed with practical and legal information covering every aspect of getting financial support for a charitable organization, whether from foundations, individual donors, through special events or crowdfunding,.To do fundraising right primarily requires common sense, an interest in people, and a desire to tell the world about the work of your organization. Like many who&#x2019;ve done development at a professional level, my first experiences were simply helping out within an organization for whom I worked in a different capacity. I didn&#x2019;t do too badly&#x2015;but I could have done so much better if I&#x2019;d known what experienced fundraisers know. <br> There is a method and science to fundraising, and learning more can save an organization many false steps and wasted hours. Not to mention that nonprofits must operate within certain legal parameters, and certain mistakes by the development department could actually put the organization&#x2019;s tax-exempt status at risk.</p><h2>Marshfield Dreams: When I Was a Kid</h2><p><p><b>The colorful boyhood of a popular author comes to life in this personal account</b></p><p>Imagine learning from a nosy classmate that your mother is having yet another baby. To Ralph's classmates, news of one more Fletcher baby is just "scuttlebutt." But for Ralph, the oldest of nine, being part of a large family means more kids to join in the fun&#x2015;from making tripods in the woods and "snicking" up the rug to raising chicks and even discovering a meteor (well, maybe). It doesn't feel like there's life beyond Marshfield, Massachusetts. Then one day Dad's new job moves the family to Chicago, and there's so much Ralph has to leave behind. In this humorous and captivating memoir, Ralph Fletcher traces the roots of his storytelling.</p></p><p><b>Ralph Fletcher</b> is the author of a wide range of books for young readers, from picture books (<i>The Sandman</i>) to novels (<i>The One O'Clock Chop</i>), from memoirs (<i>Marshfield Dreams</i>) to writing advice (<i>Guy-Write</i>). He also teaches workshops on poetry and writing. Mr. Fletcher lives with his family in Lee, New Hampshire.<p>Marshfield Dreams</p> <p>Marshfield</p> <p>THERE&#x2019;S A TOWN called Marshfield in the state of Vermont. You can also find a Marshfield in Maine, one in Missouri,and one in Wisconsin. I grew up in Marshfield,Massachusetts. The curly part of Massachusetts that sticks out into the ocean is Cape Cod. Marshfield sits on the ocean,just above that curl.</p> <p>I lived on Acorn Street in a regular house bordered by forest on two sides. Dad owned seven acres of woods in back. Across a dirt driveway we had Ale&#x2019;s Woods,a forest of pine trees. The pines dropped millions of needles,which gave the forest floor a nice,springy feel. Those trees were great for climbing. If I crawled out too far on a limb and fell,the soft needles cushioned my fall,so I never got hurt.</p> <p>The woods held magical things. We found snake skins,real Indian arrowheads,box turtles, beehives,snake spit on tall grass. We dug up the buried trash from people who lived there many years before. We saw gravestones so old we could no longer read the names carved in them. We found all kinds of mushrooms. Some were edible, and others were poisonous toadstools. Mom said to think of them as strangers&#x2014;some are good, some are bad,and since you couldn&#x2019;t tell the difference it was best to leave them alone. One morning in the woods I stepped into a fairy ring of mushrooms,a big circle ten feet across.</p> <p>There was a tiny stream in our backyard small enough so you could step from one bank to theother. This stream flowed under the dirt driveway and formed a swamp at the edge of Ale&#x2019;s Woods. I loved the dank smell of that swamp and all the things that lived there: mossy logs and goggle-eyed frogs,bloodsuckers and eels and foul-smelling skunk cabbage. Half the swamp was underwater,and the other half contained thick, dense mud. It was impossible to walk through that muck without getting stuck. More than once I tried and left behind one of my sneakers,a lost sole sunk forever at the bottom of the swamp. I got in trouble for that. But today I&#x2019;m glad to know that something of mine was left behind in Marsh-field.</p> <p>Here is my story.</p> <p>Junior</p> <p>AS THE OLDEST of nine,I was named after my father and my grandfather. Some kids on Acorn Street teased me,calling: "Hey,Juuuu-nioooor!" not that I minded. I liked having the same name as my father,but it did cause confusion in the house.</p> <p>Whenever Mom called out,"Ralph!" Dad and I would both answer,"Yeah?"</p> <p>"No,Big Ralph!" or, "Little Ralph!" she yelled back,to clarify things. I guess that would have annoyed some people,but it didn&#x2019;t really bother me. Dad was tall and handsome. I bragged to my friends that my father was so cool he had three jobs: teacher,milkman,bartender. I was proud of him. I loved knowing that Ralph could fit us both in one snug syllable.</p> <p>Statue</p> <p>BY THE TIME I was three I already had a brother, Jimmy,who was a year younger than me. My sister Elaine was a year younger than Jim. Dad worked as a traveling book salesman,and Mom took care of us when Dad was away. Dad came home on Friday nights. On Saturdays,after breakfast,the whole family would play outside.</p> <p>As soon as I saw Mom and Dad coming out the door,I&#x2019;d get excited and run to the big boulder in the front yard. We were about to play my favorite game,Statue. I arranged my body in a certain pose and froze. Then I closed my eyes,waiting. My heart beat faster as they came closer.</p> <p>"What&#x2019;s this?" Dad asked.</p> <p>"It looks like a statue!" Mom said. She had Jimmy and Lainie in the stroller and pushed them closer.</p> <p>"A statue of a little boy!" Dad exclaimed. "It&#x2019;s beautiful! It&#x2019;s absolutely perfect! Amazing!"</p> <p>Mom knelt to touch my nose. I could feel the eyes of my whole family studying me closely. Jimmy laughed. The baby just stared.</p> <p>"A little boy carved in stone!" Mom exclaimed. "You think we could buy it?"</p> <p>"Hey look!" Dad said. "There&#x2019;s a price tag right here on the sleeve!"</p> <p>I remained absolutely still,barely breathing, while Dad examined the invisible tag.</p> <p>"How much?" Mom asked impatiently. "How much is it?"</p> <p>"It&#x2019;s a lot&#x2014;one hundred dollars!" Dad told her. "But who cares? It&#x2019;s worth every penny! I&#x2019;d pay five hundred dollars for a statue like this! I&#x2019;d pay a thousand!"</p> <p>I tried hard not to smile.</p> <p>"Excuse me,madam," Dad said to baby Lainie. "Is this your store? My wife and I would like to buy this statue here. A hundred dollars? Certainly. Here you go. Ten,twenty thirty forty fifty sixty seventy eighty ninety one hundred. What? Ship it? No,no thank you. We&#x2019;ll just put it in our car and drive it home."</p> <p>He handed Lainie to Mom and picked me up. With me in his lap,stiff as a board,he sat on the boulder. Mom sat beside him. Dad pretended to turn on the car ignition.</p> <p>"Drive carefully," Mom said. "We don&#x2019;t want the statue to get damaged."</p> <p>"Don&#x2019;t worry," Dad replied, while turning the steering wheel. He pretended to park the car. "Here we are."</p> <p>"Where should we put the statue?" Mom asked.</p> <p>"I&#x2019;ve got the perfect place for it," he said. "Right here in our front yard."</p> <p>"How wonderful," Mom exclaimed. "We&#x2019;ve got two boys,but I&#x2019;ve always wanted another."</p> <p>"Look at the detail on the face." Dad bent down to examine me closely. "It almost looks alive!"</p> <p>That was my cue. Slowly,I lifted my chin and looked up,first at my father,then at my mother.</p> <p>"My goodness!" they shouted. "He&#x2019;s alive!"</p> <p>Hugs! Kisses!</p> <p>"It&#x2019;s a real boy!" Dad exclaimed. "Would you like to live with us?"</p> <p>Shyly,I nodded. With more hugs and kisses, they welcomed me into the family.</p> <p>"It&#x2019;s a miracle," Dad kept saying. "An absolute miracle."</p> <p></p> <p>Excerpted from Marshfield dreams by Ralph Fletcher.<br>Copyright � 2005 by Ralph Fletcher.<br>Published in First edition-2005 by Henry Holt and Company.<br>All rights reserved.

It nuzzled her hand.<br> Kate giggled. The horse lifted its head and whinnied. It had a white stripe on its nose and<br> white feet.<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get your arm bitten off, or we&#x2019;ll miss the game!&#x201d; her cousin Mike Walsh said. He was tossing a baseball from one hand to the other. &#x201c;Red Gibson is going to set the Cardinals&#x2019; hitting streak record tonight! He&#x2019;s hit in thirty- three straight games so far.&#x201d;<br> Kate reached back up to pet the horse again. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, Mike. We&#x2019;re not going to miss any of the action,&#x201d; she said.<br> The horse and five other Clydesdale horses were hitched to a tall red delivery wagon with big white wheels. At the beginning of the base- ball game, the horses would pull the wagon inside the stadium while a bouncy &#x201c;oompah-pah&#x201d; song played. The Clydesdales appeared at St. Louis Cardinals games on special occasions and for the first and last games of the season. They were at today&#x2019;s game for the Cardinals&#x2019; Lewis and Clark Days celebration.<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; the horse team driver said to Mike. &#x201c;Duke doesn&#x2019;t bite.&#x201d; The driver wore bright green pants with yellow stripes down the side and a crisp white shirt with a black tie. A name tag on his shirt read manny. Manny reached over and gave Duke a pat. &#x201c;Well, maybe he&#x2019;d bite you if you were a Pittsburgh Pirates fan!&#x201d; he joked.<br> Manny&#x2019;s partner, Tommy, laughed. Tommy was polishing the wagon. He was dressed like Manny. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have to worry about the Pirates tonight,&#x201d; Tommy said. &#x201c;Red Gibson is sure to continue his hitting streak.&#x201d;<br> It was six o&#x2019;clock in the evening. Mike and Kate were in the groundskeepers&#x2019; area in the Cardinals&#x2019; stadium. Kate&#x2019;s mother, Mrs. Hopkins, had arranged for the kids to visit with the horses. She was a sports reporter and often brought Mike and Kate with her to games.<br> People bustled all around them. Grounds- keepers were fetching rakes and supplies. On the other side of a garage door was the stadium&#x2019;s outfield. A groundskeeper with a mustache stood just inside the door, dipping pretzels into a jar of peanut butter and munching on them as he watched the other groundskeepers. He seemed to be the boss.<br> The noise of the fans finding their seats flooded in through the open doorway. Nearby, Manny and Tommy were getting the horses ready for their appearance on the field.<br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get a photo!&#x201d; Kate said.<br> Mike pulled out his phone. But before he could take the picture, he noticed a baseball player on the other side of the wagon.<br> &#x201c;Hey, it&#x2019;s Red Gibson!&#x201d; Mike said. &#x201c;What are you doing here?&#x201d;<br> Red stood tall in his St. Louis uniform. He had a bushy black beard and long arms and legs. His young face looked friendly. He smiled at Mike and Kate and walked over to shake their hands.<br> &#x201c;Hello there!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I came down for a good-luck visit before the game. I do a lot of charity events with Manny and Tommy, and I like to spend time with the animals.&#x201d;<br> Manny laughed. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t just like these animals; you <i>love</i> them!&#x201d; he said. He looked at Mike and Kate. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never met someone who loves animals more. He&#x2019;s even studying to be a veterinarian when he retires from baseball.&#x201d; Manny patted the side of the old-fashioned delivery wagon. &#x201c;I know someone who&#x2019;s going to be thrilled to see you, Red.&#x201d;<br> <i>WHEEET! WOOO!</i><br> Manny gave a loud whistle. A black-and- white blur flashed down from the driver&#x2019;s seat of the wagon. Mike and Kate felt something brush past their legs.<br> Two big paws landed on Red&#x2019;s chest, and a long pink tongue darted out to lick the side of his face!<br> &#x201c;Louie!&#x201d; Red called out. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my boy! You&#x2019;re my special good-luck charm!&#x201d;<br> Louie, a large Dalmatian, continued to lick and nuzzle Red. Red petted the dog&#x2019;s back. &#x201c;As long as you&#x2019;re here, I know I&#x2019;ll be able to set a new hitting record!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Maybe I should see if Coach can make you the mascot for our team!&#x201d;<br> Manny held up his hand. &#x201c;Not so fast, Red,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We need Louie to travel with the horses. Dalmatians have always helped keep the horses calm.&#x201d;<br> Tommy stood up from cleaning the wheels of the wagon. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not a bad idea,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If Red keeps Louie, we can focus on the horses. Maybe we can get a stuffed Dalmatian.&#x201d;<br> Manny shook his head. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a horrible idea, Tommy!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The horses love Louie. Red&#x2019;s not getting the dog.&#x201d;<br> Tommy shrugged and went back to work. &#x201c;Whatever,&#x201d; he mumbled.<br> Red gave Louie one more hug. &#x201c;Down, boy,&#x201d; he said. Louie dropped to the ground and looked at Mike and Kate.<br> &#x201c;I think Louie would like to meet you,&#x201d; Red said. &#x201c;Shake!&#x201d;<br> Louie sat and then held up his paw for Mike to shake.<br> Mike laughed. &#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re trying to teach me a trick, are you?&#x201d; he said. Mike shook Louie&#x2019;s paw. &#x201c;Nice to meet you!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Attaboy!&#x201d; Red said. He let Louie give him another lick and a handshake. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to stay here with you, but I have a game to play. And since you&#x2019;re my favorite furry friend, I&#x2019;m going to set a hitting record for you tonight!&#x201d;<br> Mike held out his baseball and pulled a marker from his back pocket. &#x201c;Red! Would you be willing to sign my ball first?&#x201d; he asked.<br> Red smiled. &#x201c;Sure!&#x201d; he said. He took Mike&#x2019;s ball and signed his name across its sweet spot. Then he handed it back to Mike.<br> &#x201c;Thanks!&#x201d; Mike said.<br> &#x201c;No problem,&#x201d; Red said. He waved goodbye and disappeared into a hallway.<br> &#x201c;That was so cool to meet Red Gibson!&#x201d; Kate said. &#x201c;And Louie!&#x201d; She gave the dog a hug and then checked the time. &#x201c;We need to get going,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s find our seats so we can watch Louie, Duke, and the rest of the horses parade around the field before the game!&#x201d;<br> As Mike and Kate turned to leave, one of the Cardinals clubhouse attendants walked by and opened a door to the loading zone outside. <br> Louie pricked up his ears. The last rays of sunlight shone through the open door. At the sight, Louie took off in a flash. <br> &#x201c;Hey, look out!&#x201d; Kate called.<br> Before anyone could grab him, Louie dashed out the door!</p><h2>The Jeweler&#39;s Directory of Gemstones: A Complete Guide to Appraising and Using Precious Stones From Cut and Color to Shape and Settings</h2><p><p> <i>For goldsmiths, collectors, jewelry-makers, investors, retailers and consumers.</i> </p><p> The trade of gemstones is a highly specialized and often secretive business.

No parents are around, so the wren takes in her surroundings: Lloyd-Jones (The House That&#x2019;s Your Home) repeatedly references &#x201c;monarchs in the milkweed,&#x201d; rustling switch grass, and a &#x201c;glittering river&#x201d; below. Several animals are nearby, and the wren wishes it could dive like a kingfisher, cartwheel like ring-tailed cats, or brave a storm like two eagles. In the end, the wren&#x2019;s ability to bear witness to the beauty around her (&#x201c;what she saw couldn&#x2019;t fit inside her/ it bumped into her heart/ it dazzled in her eyes/ it pushed on her throat&#x201d;) and to convert that appreciation into a praise-song of gratitude reveals that she is exactly who she ought to be. Lovely, precise detail characterizes Corace&#x2019;s (Telephone) watercolor-and-pencil portraits of the animals and their habitat; her pale pink skies, craggy golden canyon walls, and wispy grasses make it easy to understand why the wren is moved to sing. Ages 4&#x2013;8. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>A little bird explores her environment, meeting other creatures with special talents before discovering her own. The baby wren is first seen alone in her nest, but she soon hops out and meets other birds, animals, and fish. To the tiny bird, the soaring kingfisher and eagles, splashing sunfish, and cartwheeling ring-tailed cats are amazing and accomplished, doing spectacular things that astonish a na�ve little bird. In classic find-your-own-talent fashion, the baby wren is then so inspired by a glowing, pink sunrise that she is moved to sing her own song, which can be heard all over the canyon. The lyrical text uses rich, poetic imagery along with judicious repetition to create a memorable setting for the little bird's exploratory journey. A large format and double-page-spread illustrations in jewel tones make the canyon setting appealing, though the bird is sometimes dwarfed by the expansive vistas. When the baby wren finds her own voice, she offers a big, open-ended thank you for everything in her world. There is no overt religious content in the text, though there is a short quotation on the front cover flap referring to prayer and a brief quote on the back cover flap from Martin Luther about the power of song. An attractive visual presentation complements an engaging text for a fresh interpretation of an old theme. (Picture book. 4-8) (<i>Kirkus</i>)<br><br>This adorable book opens with Baby Wren peeking out from her tiny nest in a rock face crevice and spying the wonders in the canyon that surrounds her: flittering butterflies, diving kingfishers, ring-tailed cats, and eagles sailing through the sky high above her. These miraculous things make her wish she had something of value that she could do. Then she sees the sun casting a pink glow upon the walls of the canyon in which she lives, and her heart becomes overwhelmed by the beauty around her. She bursts into song -- her special great gift -- one she unknowingly shares with the creatures around her. Baby Wren and the Great Gift is a delightful book with a special meaning for all of us: no matter how big or small, each of us has a special God-given gift we can share with others. As a mother and grandmother, I believe that message is especially important, for all children must learn that each of us is unique in our own special way, that we all have special talents to share with others. It just sometimes takes time to discover what they are. Baby Wren and the Great Gift is a hardback book designed for children 4-8 years of age (Preschool to Grade 2), and is beautifully written by award-winning Sally Lloyd-Jones, a leading writer of inspirational books for children. The book, approximately 11' wide x 9-1/4' high, is expertly illustrated by the highly talented Jen Corace. Her brightly colored vistas often flow across two open pages, providing a delightful panorama of the world around Baby Wren. Children and parents will love each scene and sharing the heart-warming messages contained within this exquisite book. It's bound to be a favorite that children will want to read again and again. (<i>MyShelf.com</i>)<br><br>This gentle read-aloud proves that everyone has a special gift to share as a baby wren leaves her nest to explore the world. Venturing out into the beautiful canyon, a kingfisher invites the wren to go fishing, ring-tailed cats ask her to join them in cartwheels, sunfish call to splash in the river, and eagles ask her to soar high above the storm clouds. But the baby wren cannot dive, do cartwheels, swim, or soar, compelling her to predictably ask why she cannot do these things. Lloyd-Jones&#x2019;s lyrical text follows a comfortable pattern of wren&#x2019;s unanswered question to each of her new friends (&#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t I a sunfish...so I could swim and splash, too?) always followed by the refrain &#x201c;But no one answered./Monarchs played in the milkweed./A breeze rustled in the switch grass./And the glittering river ran on.&#x201d; Corace&#x2019;s fine-lined and brightly colored drawings show the scenic details of the wren&#x2019;s surroundings and the spectacular sunset as she discovers the magnificent call deep in her chest. Finding her special gift, the wren fills the canyon with a birdsong of thanks for all to hear. VERDICT Lovely and lyrical, this is a comforting story to be shared at storytime, bedtime, or anytime children are looking for reassurance of their special gifts.&#x2013;Kristine M. Casper, Huntington Public Library, NY (<i>School Library Journal</i>)<br><br>Baby Wren looks out at the world around her, full of the wonder of ring-tailed cats cartwheeling over the walls of tall rock ledges and brave eagles soaring high in a stormy sky. What could a little bird like her do to match the wonder around her? She has no tail, she cannot swim, and she is much too little to be brave like an eagle. As the baby wren continues to explore the beauty around her, will she despair over what she lacks or instead discover a special gift? Baby Wren and the Great Gift by Sally Lloyd-Jones is an inspiring story of the wonder and beauty of the natural world as seen through the eyes of a newborn bird, who longs to be a part of it all but sees herself as miniscule in light of the other marvelous creatures. Yet through one glorious sight, the baby wren discovers her gift, finding her special purpose in God&#x2019;s wondrous world. The story is told in a narrative fashion, the baby wren an apparent observer of all the beauty around her; however, there is a clear shift in perspective in the final two pages as the baby wren is then included in the description of the sights and sounds of the canyon. This shift from observer to participant mirrors the wren&#x2019;s discovery of her place and part in creation. The rich, earth-toned color scheme of the illustrations brings warmth to the text and delights the eyes. Overall, this picture book is a story of self-discovery and belonging, which leads to thankfulness and praise, and would pair well with The Sleepy Songbird by Suzanne Barton.

Unlike most books written to help those struggling with their testimonies, Bridges: Ministering to Those Who Question is geared at helping local leaders and family members better understand the sources of these challenges and how to minister to those affected by them. This ministering is done through building bridges of love, empathy, and trust regardless of whether or not someone retains their belief or continues to participate. Author David B.

When we do, they have often been secularized or commercialized. Instead of ministering angels who reveal God&#x2019;s love and mercy, we hear about &#x201c;angel investors&#x201d; or we gobble up foil-wrapped chocolate angels at Christmas. But Joan Wester Anderson trusts that angels still walk among us.<br><br> On mountain slopes, on desolate rural highways, in airplane cockpits&#x2014;these are just a few of the many places where ordinary people have felt the very real presence and power of God&#x2019;s angels at work in their lives. In this twenty-fifth anniversary edition of her <i>New York Times</i> best-selling book <i>Where Angels Walk</i>, Joan Wester Anderson (the &#x201c;Angel Lady&#x201d;) offers dozens of reasons&#x2014;stories, actually&#x2014;for us to reconsider our rather limited view of angels. In addition to the original collection of angelic encounters, several new stories have been included.<br><br> Anderson, who holds traditional Christian beliefs about angels, was careful to select only those stories that had a ring of truth to them. But are they true? Do heavenly visitors really walk among us? Open this book&#x2014;along with your heart&#x2014;before you decide.</p><p>This was the book that started it all for Joan Wester Anderson! It is her first book in her series where she shares inspiring true experiences of ordinary people who believe that they have met and been helped by angels. And it spent 55 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list. <br><br>The book began as a personal pilgrimage for Joan when, on Christmas Even in 1983, her son and his roommate were rescued from certain death. In the midst of subzero temperatures and gale-force winds, a man appeared and brought them to safety...and then disappeared. Unseen by others, he left no tracks beside theirs in the snow. Grateful and intrigued, she set out to explore an explanation for this incident only to discover that many others have had similar experiences.If you believe in angels, then you will rejoice in this thrilling collection of stories attesting to angelic intervention in human affairs. If you do not believe, you may find yourself wavering as you read true stories of intervention. This exhilarating book offers overwhelming evidence that heavenly beings are very much with us -- combating evil, bringing news, warning of danger, consoling us in our suffering. It may even help you remember a time in our own life when an angel walked beside you.</p><h2>Surrounded by Love: Seven Teachings from St. Francis</h2><p>In his newest book, Fr. Murray Bodo, OFM, brings to life seven teachings from the life and writings of St. Francis of Assisi in the prayerful, lyrical style his readers will recognize. These seven teachings are both a way and a destination, the way being transformation and the destination being the love of God. St Francis invites us to go on a journey from love through love into love.<br><br> The seven teachings outlined here&#x2014;plus an eighth teaching on love, the teaching behind all teachings&#x2014;define a spirituality for our own time that anyone can learn to practice in his or her own life, anyone who has an attitude of reverence for others and for the earth and all of nature, and who acknowledges the existence of a higher power that is beyond what one can perceive with the senses.&nbsp;<br><br> St. Francis was not a medieval theologian but a teacher of wisdom who used sayings, stories, and rituals to show us how we can allow God to transform our lives. In this, as in everything else, he was following in the footsteps of Jesus, who is the mystery of the fullness of God among us. You, too, can follow in Jesus&#x2019; footsteps with these teachings:<ul><li>The First Teaching: The Wonder of the Incarnation</li><li>The Second Teaching: The Paradox of Evangelical Poverty</li><li>The Third Teaching: Live the Gospel</li><li>The Fourth Teaching: Go and Repair God&#x2019;s House</li><li>The Fifth Teaching: Making Peace</li><li>The Sixth Teaching: All Creatures Are Our Brothers and Sisters</li><li>The Seventh Teaching: The Joy of Humble Praise and Service of God</li><li>The Teaching of Teachings: Love</li></ul>This simple map for living is why St. Francis is still admired today in our fractious and divided world. What he teaches, if lived, brings joy, which is the result of union with God, who lives with us and within all of creation.<br><br> Meditating on these teachings from St. Francis will give you hope; for hope is the grace to imagine a future more positive, more loving, and more joyful than the world we now find ourselves in. As St. Francis used to say to his brothers, &#x201c;Let us begin to do good, for up to now we have done nothing.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>MURRAY BODO, O.F.M., is a Franciscan priest and member of the Franciscan Academy.

Murray Bodo has lost nothing of the joy, freshness and vitality that characterized his writing when he was a newly vowed young friar. Yet, his latest work,&nbsp;<i>Surrounded by Love: Seven Teachings from Saint Francis</i>, possesses something else: wisdom. It is a gift received after a lifetime spent serving others: as friar and priest, as pilgrimage leader, as teacher and mentor, as companion to the countless friends he has made around the world. What emerges here are seven teachings passed on to Fr. Murray through close and intimate relationship not only with St. Francis of Assisi, but with Jesus Christ himself. Thank you, Fr.

Is it because we spend too much time sitting in front of the TV? Is it because we drink those huge sugary soft drinks or that junk food advertising is often geared toward kids? Everyone has an opinion: Healthy food is too expensive. Schools are the problem, since most did away with recess and serve unhealthy food. Our portion sizes are too big, and we're eating too many wheat-based products. The list is endless. People want to blame someone or one specific thing--and everyone wants a simple solution.<br><br>There's no doubt that overweight and obesity are huge health problems in our country. Americans have been gaining weight year after year since the early 1980s. In fact, we published a study in Science in 2003 showing that the average weight gain in adults is about 2 �ds per year. This may not seem like a lot, but it adds up to 20 extra �ds in a decade!<br><br>What has caused this increase in weight gain? The American lifestyle has changed so much in the past 30 years--nearly everything about the places we live, work, and play is different--that it's impossible to assign blame to any one, two, or even three things. More important, though, we don't believe that "Why is America getting so fat?" is the right question. There are people who are lean and healthy. Some of them have always been this way; others have managed to lose weight and keep it off for a very long time. We've been asking, "How do these people do it?" With the Colorado Diet, our focus is on what people have done right.<br><br>Colorado is a perfect learning laboratory in which to study what's effective and what isn't for weight loss because there are many, many people here doing it right. While the rest of the nation has been packing on the �ds, Coloradans have avoided the high rates of obesity seen elsewhere. The state has the lowest obesity prevalence in the nation, about 26 percent below the national average. However, not everyone in Colorado is lean--just being a Coloradan doesn't give you immunity against the factors that contribute to obesity. You have to live the Colorado lifestyle actively.<br><br>In studying the Colorado lifestyle, we discovered six key factors that make healthy living easy and are necessary for developing a Mile-High Metabolism (we describe this in greater detail in Chapter 2). We think they explain why Coloradans are the leanest people in the nation. What's more, in comparing the habits of lean Coloradans to those of the participants in the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR), we determined that you don't need be a Colorado resident to adopt this lifestyle. Those people live across the country, proving you can be a weight-loss success story anywhere. In the chapters that follow, we'll go into greater detail about each one of the factors and show you how to incorporate them into your daily life. But for now, we wanted to give you an overview.<br><br>1 / Be Active Every Day<br><br>A few years ago, we worked with Harris Polls to research the walking habits of people across the United States and published the results in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise. Participants wore pedometers to count the number of steps they took each day. Turns out that the national average was about 5,500 steps (about 2 to 21/2 miles), but Coloradans took 1,000 additional steps. We weren't surprised to find that obesity rates were correlated to the number of steps taken. In Arkansas and Tennessee, where obesity rates are among the highest in the country, residents took only 4,500 steps per day.<br><br>There's no getting around it--to stay lean, you must be consistently active. Without regular movement, your metabolism becomes slow, sluggish, and inflexible. And an inflexible metabolism makes weight gain inevitable and lasting weight loss next to impossible. Whether it's a walk with the dog, a hike with a friend, a bike ride, or a workout at the gym, movement is a priority in Colorado, not another dreaded task on the to-do list. Some of us get up early, others fit it in between obligations, but the key is we always find a way.<br><br>If this feels foreign and seems daunting to you now, don't despair. In Chapter 4, we help you discover the joy of movement and show you how to make it part of your life.<br><br>2 / Fuel Up on Real Food<br><br>With all that activity, Coloradans love to eat, but we're selective about our food. We look for fresh and local fare, sustainably grown and harvested, where possible. Just about every neighborhood has a farmers' market, and health and organic food stores are very popular, too. (In fact, several major health food chains originated in Colorado.) The majority of our calories come from minimally processed foods that deliver the most flavor and nutrition so our bodies perform at their best. We don't waste our calories on foods with low nutritional value, although we do love our occasional indulgences.<br><br>A passion for adventure and new experiences is common here, and food is no exception. Many Coloradans identify as "foodies" and love to cook and seek out inventive restaurants that serve fresh, delicious meals. At restaurants and at home, the emphasis is on quality, not quantity. A healthy-size portion of a great-tasting dish is better than a huge serving of fare that's filled with refined carbohydrates, fat, and sodium--even if that big portion costs less money.<br><br>Our friends Debbie and Tim exemplify the Colorado Diet philosophy we discuss in Chapter 5. They love to cook, and even though they live in downtown Denver, they grow their own vegetables in the neighborhood community garden. On a typical Sunday, they might walk or bike to the grocery stores in their neighborhood to pick up a few ingredients for dinner. Debbie prefers making simple meals with fresh ingredients. One of their favorite dinners is sauteed vegetables and herbs tossed with pasta and topped with a little Parmesan cheese--it's tasty, and Debbie can put it together in just a few minutes after work. The couple joined a local farm share program that provides them with a box of fresh, locally produced foods each week. They are both lean and active and readily admit that a major reason they are active is to be able to enjoy the food they love.<br><br>3 / Create Your Own Healthy Environment<br><br>Colorado is famous for its beautiful scenery and ample opportunities for outdoor recreation. Active people are drawn to our state because of our weather (more than 300 days of sunshine a year), mountains, walking and biking trails, and lots of parks and open spaces. It's hard to stay inside. Of course, it's easier to be active when you're in this kind of environment.<br><br>But the typical Coloradan doesn't hike a tall peak before breakfast every day--or even once a month. It's our communities and immediate surroundings-- the plethora of parks, the bike paths in our neighborhoods, and our friendly walking groups--that provide an important nudge for healthy living.<br><br>And if you're looking for someone to join you on a hike or a bike ride, you don't have to look far. In Colorado, you're likely to rub elbows with a triathlete or trail runner or hiker at a movie, party, or neighborhood event. Your neighbor may be the local running club coach or the organizer of a local charity walk. It seems like everyone owns a bike and a dog. It's not uncommon to begin conversations by talking about the last race you walked or ran rather than what you do for a living. These interactions make living an active lifestyle the norm. This "social circle effect" is exemplified by research done at Harvard University that found that people in the same social network (i.e., groups of friends) tended to have similar body mass indices (body mass index is a measure of obesity). If you're surrounded by friends and family who are overweight, you're more likely to be overweight. Now, this doesn't mean that obesity is contagious; rather it's just that you're likely to engage in the same eating and physical activity patterns as the people you spend most of your time with. And it goes both ways--surround yourself with active people and you become more active, too.<br><br>4 / Stay True to Your Purpose<br><br>We all have an inner purpose (what we want to accomplish with our lives), but you may not have ever connected your purpose with weight-loss success. Consider this: Is the way you are living your life consistent with what you want to achieve? For Coloradans, being in good shape physically gives them the energy and confidence to do the things that are most important to them, whether it's about providing for family, achieving professional success, or pursuing what they've always wanted to do in retirement. If you recognize how losing weight and keeping it off will help you better reach your goals in life, you will have a powerful motivator to succeed. Making that connection is what spurs you to get up early to hit the gym--even if it's icy cold outside--or gives you the willpower to pass on the second portion at dinner. Living healthfully then becomes a key value in your life and provides motivation for everything you do--and that makes it much more likely that you will enjoy the Colorado lifestyle. Finding your purpose and connecting it to your weight loss goals is an essential factor for success. It's part of the Colorado mind-set we discuss in Chapter 3.<br><br>5 / Believe You Can Succeed<br><br>During your weight-loss journey, you will face many challenges and small setbacks. Dealing with them in a way that doesn't derail your plan requires keeping a positive mind-set. Your mental outlook can determine how effective you are in making permanent changes in your life. If you believe you can't do something, you probably won't. For you to succeed in losing weight and keeping it off, you have to have faith in your power to change and not get caught up in thinking you're a victim and have no control over the things you perceive as barriers to success. It sounds simplistic, but the idea that having a positive attitude can help you achieve amazing results is backed by science. Research psychologist Barbara Fredrickson, PhD, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a leader in the field of positive psychology, has shown that cultivating a positive mind- set can enhance relationships, improve work performance, reduce depression, and contribute to better health. In general, Coloradans have an upbeat attitude. It's not that everyone is running around happy all the time. It's more a sensibility that you are responsible for your own happiness. Instead of saying, "I'll believe it when I see it," Coloradans tend to have the mind-set that if you believe it, you will see it. (Chapter 3 discusses this concept in greater detail.)<br><br>It's our experience that people who choose to see a lifestyle change in positive terms do much better than those who don't. Consider Melissa, who came to our weight-loss clinic with a negative mind-set. She was constantly talking about all the foods she couldn't eat on her diet plan. She bemoaned the absence of a chocolate dough-nut every morning and complained that Sunday football was just not the same without chicken wings, pizza, and her favorite cold beer. She had to exercise every day, and that meant getting up earlier--and she hated getting up earlier. She was losing weight but struggling and even told us we were making her life miserable. You could feel the negative energy when you were in the room with her.<br><br>To turn things around, we made it a priority to get her to concentrate on what she liked about her new lifestyle. Each time we met, we asked her to tell us two things she really enjoyed that week and two things she was grateful for. Over time, her mind-set shifted from feeling like a victim to feeling empowered by her ability to create a new way of living. She began to appreciate the opportunities and not chafe against the requirements of her new lifestyle. Melissa not only lost 40 �ds but has kept them off for over a year. We even overheard her telling a new patient that you have the power to make this a great experience or a terrible one--it's your choice.<br><br>PARACHUTING INTO WELLNESS<br><br>In September 2011, our colleague John Peters, PhD, moved to Denver from Cincinnati to join our group at the Anschutz Health and Wellness Center. He didn't come here seeking to lose weight. Instead, it happened accidentally. We'll let him explain.<br><br>I'd visited Colorado many times over the years and always felt drawn to its natural beauty--the Rocky Mountains, the intense sunlight, and the infinite blue sky. When I decided to move here from Ohio, I felt as if I'd literally parachuted into wellness.<br><br>One of the first things I noticed in Colorado was the bicycles--they were everywhere! I've always been a cyclist, but until I relocated to Denver, I had to put my bike on the car roof and drive somewhere to ride. Now, in my neighborhood, I'm only a half mile from the High Line Canal bike trail. I hop on my bike at home and ride to the trailhead. There I can connect to a large network of trails that can take me practically anywhere I want to go!<br><br>When I first moved in, I assumed my neighborhood was some sort of planned fitness community. People were out walking at all times of the day and night. But eventually, I realized that all this walking is perfectly normal in Colorado--whether there's a foot of snow on the ground or it is 100 degrees outside, people are outside doing something active. A park across the street from my home has a 2-mile-long trail around it. The first month that I moved in, I signed up for a 5-K in my neighborhood park in hopes of meeting some new people. In a single weekend, I made connections with an entire group of people I could meet up with for outdoor activities.<br><br>My eating habits changed, too. My neighborhood has a farmers' market about 2 blocks away and a natural food store a few miles away, and both of them are on my Saturday grocery route. Surrounded by healthy food, it was much easier to eat well, no willpower required.</p><h2>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory: a Play</h2><p>Roald Dahl fans will rejoice at the opportunity to bring their favorite books and characters to life.

The diary he kept while tending sheep formed the heart of this book and eventually lured thousands of Americans to visit Yosemite country.<br>First published in 1911, <i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i> incorporates the lyrical accounts and sketches he produced during his four-month stay in the Yosemite River Valley and the High Sierra. His record tracks that memorable experience, describing in picturesque terms the majestic vistas, flora and fauna, and other breathtaking natural wonders of the area.<br>Today Muir is recognized as one of the most important and influential naturalists and nature writers in America. This book, the most popular of the author&#x2019;s works, will delight environmentalists and nature lovers with its exuberant observations.</p><p>John Muir, a young Scottish immigrant, had not yet become the famed conservationist whom he liked to call "John o' the Mountains" when he first trekked into the foothills of the Sierra Nevada not long after the end of the Civil War. Having caught a glimpse of such magical places as Tuolumne Meadows and El Capitan, Muir ached to return, and in the summer of 1869 he signed on with a crew of shepherds and drove a flock of 2,500 woolly critters toward the headwaters of the Merced River.<p> The diary he kept while tending sheep forms the heart of <i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i>; published in 1911, it enticed thousands of Americans to visit the Yosemite country. The book is full of the concerns Muir would later voice as America's foremost preservationist and wildlands advocate, which would bear fruit in the creation of several national parks and monuments. And it resounds with Muir's nearly pantheistic regard for the natural world: with celebrations of the Sierra's lizards that "dart about on the hot rocks, swift as dragonflies," its mountain lions and tall trees and fierce thunderstorms and bears; with Muir's overarching awe for places that civilization had yet to tame. Though perhaps a little purple by modern standards, Muir's book continues to inspire readers to seek out such places for themselves and make them their own--and as such it stands among the enduring classics of environmental literature. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><p>"The richness of Muir's writing roots deeper into the terrain than any other wilderness writer known to me." <i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>The name John Muir has come to stand for the protection of wild land and wilderness in both America and Britain. Born in Dunbar in 1838, Muir is famed as a pioneer of conservation, and his passion, discipline and vision are still inspirational today.</p><p>Combining acute observation with a sense of inner discovery, Muir's description of the summer he spent in what would become Yosemite National Park in California's Sierra Nevada mountains raises an awareness of nature to a spiritual dimension.

Based in proven-effective cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), this workbook will help you develop the self-compassion and mindfulness tools you need to counteract the negative effects of perfectionism and develop new, healthy skills for boosting your self-confidence.</b></p><p>In our high-pressure society, it&#x2019;s easy to hold ourselves (and others) to impossibly high standards. And when we fail to meet those standards&#x2014;as we inevitably do&#x2014;we may become overly critical of ourselves, or lash out toward others. While perfectionism is often associated with positive traits, such as conscientiousness, ambition, and pride in good work, dysfunctional perfectionism is destructive and can lead to anxiety, low self-esteem, relationship problems, and a number of mental health concerns, like depression, procrastination, and self-harm.</p><p>With <i>The Perfectionism Workbook for Teens</i>, you&#x2019;ll gain a clear understanding of what perfectionism is and learn to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy perfectionism so you&#x2019;ll be better able to manage your own and others&#x2019; expectations. Using powerful tools drawn from cognitive behavioral and mindfulness-based therapies, you&#x2019;ll learn to identify your perfectionist thoughts, discover new ways of responding to your critical inner voice, and build the skills you need to combat negative behaviors based in perfectionism, like chronic procrastination.</p><p>If perfectionism is causing trouble in your life, the techniques and exercises in this book will help you develop non-perfectionist skills and habits, leading to reduced fear, anxiety, and shame, and increased self-compassion and confidence in getting things done and handling daily pressures.</p></p><p><b>Ann Marie Dobosz, MA, MFT</b>, is a psychotherapist in private practice in San Francisco, CA, and mental health specialist for ReachOut USA.

Collapsing birth rates in Europe and the U. S., coupled with population explosions in Africa, Asia and Latin America are set to cause cataclysmic shifts in world power, as unchecked immigration swamps and polarizes every Western society and nation.<br><i>The Death of the West </i>details how a civilization, culture, and moral order are passing away and foresees a new world order that has terrifying implications for our freedom, our faith, and the preeminence of American democracy. </p><p><i>The Death of the West</i> is a timely, provocative study that asks the question that quietly troubles millions: Is the America we grew up in gone forever?</p></p><p>Patrick J. Buchanan's contentious premise in <i>The Death of the West</i> is that the United States is no longer a healthy melting pot, but instead a confused, tottering "conglomeration of peoples with almost nothing in common." Relying on United Nations population statistics, and citing such diverse sources as Yogi Berra and Rhett Butler, Buchanan sees for America four "clear and present dangers": declining birth rates; uncontrolled immigration of peoples of "different colors, creed, and cultures"; a rise of "anti-Western" culture antithetical to established religious, cultural, and moral norms; and a "defection of ruling elites" to the idea of world government. His solutions include higher wages and tax breaks for parents than for singles, a dramatic rollback of immigration quotas, and a National History Bee. Buchanan's volatile, adamant book eschews any middle ground. Readers will either applaud his ideas or be repulsed by them. <i>--H. O'Billovitch</i><p><b>Patrick J.

Dempsey and Brafman persuasively explain that today&#x2019;s leaders are in competition for the trust and confidence of those they lead more than ever before. They assert that the nature of power is changing and should not be measured by degree of control alone. They offer principles for adaptation and bring them to life with examples from business, academia, government, and the military.<br><br> In building their argument, Dempsey and Brafman introduce several concepts that illuminate both the vulnerability and the opportunity in leading today: <ul><li>Radical Inclusion. Fear of losing control in our fast-paced, complex, highly scrutinized environment is pushing us toward exclusion&#x2015;exactly the wrong direction. Leaders should instead develop an instinct for inclusion. The word &#x201c;radical&#x201d; emphasizes the urgency of doing so.</li><br> <li>The Era of the Digital Echo. The speed and accessibility of information create &#x201c;digital echoes&#x201d; that make facts vulnerable, eroding the trust between leader and follower. </li><br> <li>Relinquishing Control to Preserve Power. Power and control once went hand in hand, but no longer. In today&#x2019;s environment, control is seductive but unlikely to produce optimum, affordable, sustainable solutions. Leaders must relinquish and share control to build and preserve power.</li></ul><br> The principles discussed in Radical Inclusion are memorable and the book is full of engaging stories. From a young vegan&#x2019;s confrontation with opponents in Berkeley to a young lieutenant&#x2019;s surprising visitor during the Cold War, from a reflection on the significance of Burning Man to a discussion of challenges faced in the Situation Room, Radical Inclusion will provide you with leadership tools to address real leadership challenges.</p><p><b>General Martin E.

L. Stine? (Who Was?)</h2><p><b><b>Reader beware! The biography of R. L. Stine, author of the hugely popular Goosebumps series, is a scary-good time! </b></b><br><br>R. L. Stine began writing stories at the age of nine, after finding a typewriter in his family's attic. (Was it a haunted typewriter? Who can be sure?) Often referred to as the "Stephen King of children's literature," R.L. has created some of the scariest books to have ever been passed around a campfire, leaving readers wide awake at night. With over 400 million copies of his horror fiction novels sold across the world, R.L. Stine is one of the best-selling authors in history.</p><p>M. D. Payne is the author of the middle-grade series Monster Juice. He lives in New York City.<b>Who Is R.&nbsp;L. Stine?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1990, R.&nbsp;L. Stine was a successful author. He had already written a best-selling series called Fear Street. Young adults loved his spooky stories. But he wondered if he could write a series for even younger readers&#x2014;something scary, but not too scary. R.&nbsp;L. Stine never began working until he had the perfect title. He thought day and night about what to call this new children&#x2019;s series, but the name just wasn&#x2019;t coming to him.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> One morning, as he was reading the TV listings, R.&nbsp;L. saw an advertisement that said &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Goosebumps Week on Channel 11!&#x201d; And he thought that would be the perfect name for his new series: Goosebumps! He knew it was going to be something special.<br> &nbsp;<br> Goosebumps was equal parts scary and funny. It combined ideas from Fear Street and all the other scary stories, funny magazines, and silly joke books he had created as a child.<br> &nbsp;<br> By July 1992, the first book in the Goosebumps series, <i>Welcome to Dead House</i>, was in bookstores. And children around the world loved it!<br> &nbsp;<br> R.&nbsp;L. Stine&#x2019;s previous books had been popular, but nothing like this. At one point, his Goosebumps books were selling four million copies a month! The series grew into the biggest worldwide best seller of the 1990s. R.&nbsp;L. Stine worked as hard as he could. He became one of the most famous authors in the world and has written over three hundred books over the course of his career.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Along the way, the horrifying and hilarious Goosebumps tales have inspired children to read&#x2014;and to read more! Many fans race to check as many titles off their reading wish lists as they can. The series has been featured on television, in film, onstage, at sleepovers, in backyards, and around campfires all over the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1:&nbsp;A Totally Typical Family</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Robert Lawrence Stine was born in Columbus, Ohio, on October 8, 1943. Bob, as he was called by his friends and family, was the first of three children. His brother, Bill, was born three years later. His sister, Pam, was born seven years later, in 1950.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> His father, Lewis, worked for a restaurant-supply company. His mother, Anne, was a stay-at-home mom. In the city of Columbus, the Stine family lived in the wealthy neighborhood of Bexley. But their home was close to the railroad tracks&#x2014;not where the really rich families lived. Growing up in a town where most of the other kids had more money was tough for Bob&#x2014;sometimes he felt as if he didn&#x2019;t fit in.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> But Lewis and Anne always made sure their children got the best education they could, and gave them everything they needed. Bob was even able to go away to camp in the summer.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bob and Bill shared a bedroom. Before bedtime, the brothers would tell each other scary stories. Bob&#x2019;s stories were usually about a younger boy who was a lot like Bill. When Bob got to the scariest part, he would end the story quickly. Bill was left wondering what terrifying thing might have happened to the kid in the story!&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bob would often get in trouble with his mother for spending too much time listening to the radio. In the early 1950s, not every home had a television set. Most people still listened to the radio for news reports, music, and entertaining story series, sometimes called &#x201c;serials.&#x201d; Bob liked <i>The Lone Ranger</i>, <i>The Shadow</i>, <i>The Whistler</i>, and <i>Gang Busters</i>. These were continuing stories with new episodes each week. Bob learned how to be a better storyteller by listening to all these radio shows. But he was too scared to listen to the show called <i>Suspense</i>, because the voice that narrated the show was so terrifying. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Radio also connected Bob with the world outside Columbus, Ohio. Most of the shows he listened to were broadcast from New York City. And Bob dreamed of moving there one day.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was a big fan of comic books, too. Bob discovered whole new worlds inside their pages. Although his mother had banned comic books from the house, Bob had found a sneaky way to read them: His barber kept a stack in the barbershop, so Bob would get a haircut every week just to read the comics! EC Comics were his favorites.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Bob wasn&#x2019;t happy just <i>reading</i> comics. He wanted to create his own funny and scary stories.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Stines lived in a big, old house with many rooms, a basement, and an attic. Bob and Bill loved exploring the attic, and one day when he was seven, Bob was lucky enough to find an old typewriter there. As soon as he found it, he started to type up stories and jokes. He&#x2019;d peck away at his work one letter at a time, with just one finger.<br> &nbsp;<br> When he was nine, Bob created his first full magazine: <i>The All New Bob Stine Giggle Book. </i>It was much smaller than a regular magazine, but it was packed with jokes, riddles, and illustrations he had drawn to go along with the words.<br> &nbsp;<br> He went on to create a series of magazines with titles like <i>Tales to Drive You Batty</i>, <i>Stine&#x2019;s Line</i>, and <i>HAH, For Maniacs Only!! </i>Bob&#x2019;s family had just bought their first TV, and his handmade magazines made fun of some of the TV shows he watched, just like the <i>Mad</i> comics he loved. He used not only the typewriter he had found in the attic but also pens, pencils, crayons, tape, glue, scissors, and a stapler. It was hard work, but being able to share his art and words with his brother and classmates, and to hear them laugh, was well worth it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bob wrote <i>so much</i>, in fact, that he rarely went outside. His parents would knock on his bedroom door and tell him to go out and play with his friends. But Bob was very shy. No matter what other kids wanted to do (or what his parents said), he would rather stay in his room, writing and drawing. Bob didn&#x2019;t mind observing what other people were doing from a distance. He was paying close attention to the world around him so that he could write stories in a very realistic way&#x2014;a way that was actually quite funny.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bob also stuck close to home because he wasn&#x2019;t really adventurous. When it was his turn to jump into the pool at summer camp like the other kids, he was too scared to do it. He wasn&#x2019;t very good at sports. And he even stayed away from his own garage after dark because he thought there was a monster hiding inside.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was happy to stay safe in his room, typing away. For a kid in grade school, he worked very hard at putting together his magazines. And all that hard work was already starting to pay off.</p><h2>Rise of the Dragons</h2><p><b>Mega bestselling author Angie Sage takes flight with an epic adventure that imagines dragons in the modern world.

She lives in the United Kingdom.Gr 3-6-In this first book of a new fantasy series from Sage, three stories tie together seamlessly. Joss and Allie are indentured servants until they find a silver dragon egg. The evil Lennix clan trains dragons to raid for dragon eggs and eat humans. Sirin is brought into a foster home after her mother is hospitalized with a serious illness. This latest adventure is reminiscent in style and tone to Sage's best-selling "Magyk" series. Young readers will enjoy many of the plot twists that may be comfortably predictable for older readers. The character development is a little flat, but readers will still sympathize with the protagonists. VERDICT Recommended for middle grade fantasy fans of Sage's previous works, Brandon Mull's "Fablehaven," Jonathan Stroud's "Bartimaeus Trilogy," or Maile Meloy's The Apothecary.-Rachel Reinwald, Lake Villa District Library, IL&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

As a loving mother, she would have pondered every moment of His precious life and every experience she had with Him. She would have pondered His conception, His birth, His presentation in the temple, His public ministry, His passion and death and so much more.Through this daily devotional you are invited to prayerfully ponder the mind and heart of our Blessed Mother as she endured the great suffering inflicted upon her own dear Son. Mother Mary faced the Cross of her Son with perfect faith, love and devotion. Her fidelity to her Son throughout His life was unwavering. As she stood before the Cross during those long three hours, that fidelity never ceased.The Scriptures do not reveal much about the interior ponderings of our Blessed Mother during those three hours, but the Scriptures do reveal to us many encounters between this Mother and Son. Since the Cross was the culmination of the life of both Mother and Son, it&#x2019;s beautiful to bring to this moment of the Cross all the many experiences that these two shared throughout their earthly lives. It&#x2019;s inspiring to unite all that they did and said to this moment, since all was a preparation for this moment.This book is helpful any time of year, especially if you find yourself facing a difficult cross in your own life. It is also perfect for Lent in that it offers 40 reflections as well as prayers that can be used throughout Lent and for Holy Week.</p><p>&#34;John Paul Thomas&#34; is the pen name this priest has chosen in honor of the Apostles Saints John and Thomas and the great evangelist Saint Paul. This name also evokes the memory of the great Pope Saint John Paul II. John is the beloved Apostle who sought out a deeply personal and intimate relationship with his Savior. Hopefully the writings in this book point us all to a deeply personal and intimate relationship with our God. May John be a model of this intimacy and love. Thomas is also a beloved Apostle and close friend of Jesus but is well known for his lack of faith in Jesus&#39; Resurrection. Though he ultimately entered into a profound faith crying out, &#34;my Lord and my God,&#34; he is given to us as a model of our own weakness of faith. Thomas should inspire us to always return to faith when we realize we have doubted. As a Pharisee, Paul severely persecuted the early Christian Church. However, after going through a powerful conversion, he went on to become the great evangelist to the gentiles, founding many new communities of believers and writing many letters contained in Sacred Scripture. His letters are deeply personal and reveal a shepherd&#39;s heart. He is a model for all as we seek to embrace our calling to spread the Gospel.</p><h2>The Boys Start the War (Boy/Girl Battle)</h2><p>Just when the Hatford brothers were expecting three boys to move into the house across the river, where their best friends, the Bensons, used to live, the Malloys arrive instead.

But large-print editions of popular children's books -- from the powerhouse <i>Harry Potter</i> series to timeless classics like <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> -- are now making their way onto the shelves of the Children's Department at the Canton Library. . . . Although large-print editions are targeted to the visually-impaired or dyslexic child, they can also be used by standard-vision readers. So Kershner [Children's librarian at the Canton Public Library] has decided against creating a special section in the Children's Department (as exists in the Adult Department) opting instead to intersperse large-print books on the shelves with the regular print versions of the same titles." <br>-- <i>The Observer and Eccentric</i> (October 2000) (<i>The Observer and Eccentric</i> 20001001)<br><br>"Thorndike Press has helped me not only find books I want to read, but they also look like regular books. That's important when you're a kid and you can only read Large Print, you want your book to look like all the other books. I'm reading a lot more now that we have found Thorndike Press." <br>-- Jim Bernardin, Islamorada, FL<br><br>"Everyone loves to read, there's nothing like curling up with a good book. We're a reading family, so when our son was diagnosed with Stargardt's Disease and only able to read Large Print, it was particularly difficult. Books on tape are wonderful but they don't fill the void of actually reading a good story. Large Print books have been around a long time for older people, but to find a good novel for a young person in Large Print began to feel nearly impossible. The books that Thorndike Press publishes have truly made a difference in my son's reading life. He can enjoy current novels as well as some of the classics that he missed reading when it became too difficult with regular print."<br> -- Sara Bernardin, Islamorada, FL</p><h2>David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants</h2><p><strong>Explore the power of the underdog in Malcolm Gladwell's dazzling examination of success, motivation, and the role of adversity in shaping our lives.</strong><strong><br></strong>Three thousand years ago on a battlefield in ancient Palestine, a shepherd boy felled a mighty warrior with nothing more than a stone and a sling, and ever since then the names of David and Goliath have stood for battles between underdogs and giants. David's victory was improbable and miraculous. He <i>shouldn't </i>have won. <br><br>Or should he have? <br><br>In <i>David and Goliath</i>, Malcolm Gladwell<i> </i>challenges how we think about obstacles and disadvantages, offering a new interpretation of what it means to be discriminated against, or cope with a disability, or lose a parent, or attend a mediocre school, or suffer from any number of other apparent setbacks.<br><br>Gladwell begins with the <i>real</i> story of what happened between the giant and the shepherd boy those many years ago. From there, <i>David and Goliath</i> examines Northern Ireland's Troubles, the minds of cancer researchers and civil rights leaders, murder and the high costs of revenge, and the dynamics of successful and unsuccessful classrooms---all to demonstrate how much of what is beautiful and important in the world arises from what looks like suffering and adversity. <br><br>In the tradition of Gladwell's previous bestsellers---<i>The Tipping Point</i>, <i>Blink</i>, <i>Outliers</i> and <i>What the Dog Saw---</i><i>David and Goliath</i> draws upon history, psychology, and powerful storytelling to reshape the way we think of the world around us.</p><p>Malcolm Gladwell is the author of five <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers: <i>The Tipping Point,</i> <i>Blink, Outliers,</i> <i>What the Dog Saw,</i> and <i>David and Goliath.</i> He is also the co-founder of Pushkin Industries, an audio content company that produces the podcasts <i>Revisionist History</i>, which reconsiders things both overlooked and misunderstood, and <i>Broken Record, </i>where he, Rick Rubin, and Bruce Headlam interview musicians across a wide range of genres. Gladwell has been included in the <i>Time</i> 100 Most Influential People list and touted as one of <i>Foreign Policy</i>'s<i> </i>Top Global Thinkers.Praise for <em>Outliers</em>:<br><br>"In the vast world of nonfiction writing, Malcolm Gladwell is as close to a singular talent as exists today...<i>Outliers</i> is a pleasure to read and leaves you mulling over its inventive theories for days afterward."&#x2015;<b>David Leonhardt</b>, <b><i><em>New York Times Book Review</em></i></b><br><br>"The explosively entertaining <i>Outliers</i> might be Gladwell's best and most useful work yet...There are both brilliant yarns and life lessons here: <i>Outliers </i>is riveting science, self-help, and entertainment, all in one book."&#x2015;<b>Gregory Kirschling</b>, <b><i><em>Entertainment Weekly</em></i></b><br><br>"No other book I read this year combines such a distinctive prose style with truly thought-provoking content.

Generations of children all over the world have grown up spending hours poring over his books filled with all the colorful details of their daily lives. No other illustrator has shown such a lively interest in the words and concepts of early childhood. (Whenever he was asked how old he was, Scarry would always put up one hand and laugh, saying, "five!") <br><br>Born in 1919, Richard Scarry was raised and educated in Boston, Massachusetts. After five years of drawing maps and designing graphics for the US Army, he moved to New York to pursue a career in commercial art. But after showing his portfolio to one of the original editors at Golden Books, he found the perfect home for his work. The assignments first given to Scarry tended to be Little Golden Books that featured popular characters of the day, such as Winky Dink, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and Smokey the Bear. Eventually, Scarry created his own original characters, such as Lowly Worm and Huckle Cat. But first came Nicholas, a young rabbit clad in red overalls, for the now-iconic classic&nbsp;<i>I Am a Bunny</i>. <br><br>In his extraordinary career, Richard Scarry illustrated more than 150 books, many of which have never been out of print. His books have sold over 100 million copies around the world and are currently published in more than twenty languages. Richard Scarry Jr., also an illustrator, carries on his father's work today under the name of Huck Scarry. Richard Scarry passed away at his home in Gstaad, Switzerland in 1994.

Lose on the track and you go home. Lose with a load of whiskey and you go to jail.&#x201d; &#x2014;Junior Johnson, NASCAR legend and one-time whiskey runner<br><br>Today&#x2019;s NASCAR is a family sport with 75 million loyal fans, which is growing bigger and more mainstream by the day. Part Disney, part Vegas, part Barnum &amp; Bailey, NASCAR is also a multibillion-dollar business and a cultural phenomenon that transcends geography, class, and gender. But dark secrets lurk in NASCAR&#x2019;s past. <br><br><i>Driving with the Devil</i> uncovers for the first time the true story behind NASCAR&#x2019;s distant, moonshine-fueled origins and paints a rich portrait of the colorful men who created it. Long before the sport of stock-car racing even existed, young men in the rural, Depression-wracked South had figured out that cars and speed were tickets to a better life. With few options beyond the farm or factory, the best chance of escape was running moonshine. Bootlegging offered speed, adventure, and wads of cash&#x2014;if the drivers survived. <i>Driving with the Devil</i> is the story of bootleggers whose empires grew during Prohibition and continued to thrive well after Repeal, and of drivers who thundered down dusty back roads with moonshine deliveries, deftly outrunning federal agents. The car of choice was the Ford V-8, the hottest car of the 1930s, and ace mechanics tinkered with them until they could fly across mountain roads at 100 miles an hour. <br><br>After fighting in World War II, moonshiners transferred their skills to the rough, red-dirt racetracks of Dixie, and a national sport was born. In this dynamic era (1930s and &#x2019;40s), three men with a passion for Ford V-8s&#x2014;convicted criminal Ray Parks, foul-mouthed mechanic Red Vogt, and crippled war veteran Red Byron, NASCAR&#x2019;s first champion&#x2014;emerged as the first stock car &#x201c;team.&#x201d; Theirs is the violent, poignant story of how moonshine and fast cars merged to create a new sport for the South to call its own. <br><br><i>Driving with the Devil</i> is a fascinating look at the well-hidden historical connection between whiskey running and stock-car racing. NASCAR histories will tell you who led every lap of every race since the first official race in 1948. <i>Driving with the Devil</i> goes deeper to bring you the excitement, passion, crime, and death-defying feats of the wild, early days that NASCAR has carefully hidden from public view. In the tradition of Laura Hillenbrand&#x2019;s <i>Seabiscuit</i>, this tale not only reveals a bygone era of a beloved sport, but also the character of the country at a moment in time.</p><p>Neal Thompson is a veteran journalist who has worked for the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, and <i>St. Petersburg Times</i>, and whose magazine stories have appeared in <i>Outside</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Backpacker</i>, and <i>Men&#x2019;s Health</i>.

Why do they live at all? &#x2014;William Faulkner 1 &#x201c;NASCAR is no longer a southern sport&#x201d; The old man has seen a lot. Sometimes too much. Police in his rearview mirror. The inside of jail cells. Friends and family lowered into the ground. Race cars carving deadly paths into crowds. He&#x2019;s seen stacks of money, too&#x2014;some coming, some going. Those visions, those memories, all link into a story. The real story. The old man sits behind his orderly desk sipping a Coke, almost as if he&#x2019;s waiting for someone to come through the door and ask, &#x201c;Tell me what it was like.&#x201d; It is the start of the twenty-first century, but he is dressed in the style of an earlier era: white shirt and narrow black tie, a gray jacket and felt fedora on a nearby hook&#x2014;the same uniform he&#x2019;s worn since FDR&#x2019;s first term, except for summers, when the fedora is swapped for a straw boater. Raymond Parks is a creature of habit. He doesn&#x2019;t need to be here each day. With moonshining profits earned as a teen, he bought liquor stores, then vending machines, which funded real estate deals and other sources of income (some legal, some not quite). Far from his squalid youth, Parks is worth plenty, more than he could have imagined. He&#x2019;s sold off most of his empire&#x2014;the houses, the land, the nightclubs, the vending machines, and all of his liquor stores except one. Still, he arrives each morning to putter around the office, make phone calls, check his accounts. Next door, customers trickle into the one package store Parks has kept, the one he&#x2019;s owned for two-thirds of a century. They buy flasks of Jack Daniels and fifths of Wild Turkey from a brother-in-law who has worked for Parks since World War II. Even now, it&#x2019;s an ironic business for a teetotaler who&#x2014;as a so-called moonshine &#x201c;baron&#x201d; and &#x201c;kingpin&#x201d;&#x2014;used to make, deliver, and profit nicely from illegal corn whiskey. Outside, crews of Georgia road workers jackhammer into his parking lot, part of a road-widening project that brings Atlanta&#x2019;s Northside Avenue closer to the bespectacled old man&#x2019;s front door each day. Parks is ninety-one, though he looks two decades younger. In his twilight years, this office has become a sanctuary and the place he goes to rummage through the past. The room contains the secrets of NASCAR&#x2019;s origins. On cluttered walls and shelves are the dinged-up and tarnished trophies and loving cups, the yellowed newspaper articles, the vivid black-and-white photographs of men and machines, of crowds and crack-ups, which tell part of the story of how NASCAR came to be. Take a look: one of Parks&#x2019;s drivers is balanced impossibly on two right wheels in the north turn of the old Beach-and-Road course at Daytona; the wizard mechanic who honed his skills juicing up whiskey cars poses on the fender of a 1939 Ford V-8 coupe outside his &#x201c;24-Hour&#x201d; garage, wearing his trademark white T-shirt, white pants, and white socks; a driver stands next to his race car in front of Parks&#x2019;s office / liquor store in 1948, a dozen trophies lined up before him and Miss Atlanta smiling at his side. Parks is proud of the recent photos, too. It took many years for him to return to the sport he abandoned in 1952. When he did, NASCAR stars such as Dale Earnhardt&#x2014;his arm affectionately around Parks&#x2019;s shoulder&#x2014;embraced him as their sport&#x2019;s unsung pioneer. There were good reasons he&#x2019;d left the sport a half century earlier. That world contained dark secrets like prison and murder, greed and betrayal, the frequent maiming of friends and colleagues, their innocent fans, and the violent death of a young child. Parks keeps a few mementos from that chapter of the NASCAR story tucked neatly inside thick black photo albums, home also to faded pictures of whiskey stills, war-ravaged German cities, and a sheet-draped corpse being loaded into a hearse. The corpse had been Parks&#x2019;s cousin and stock car racing&#x2019;s first true star. He had been like a son to Parks. The day after his greatest racing victory, just as his sport was about to take off, he died. As usual, moonshine was to blame. * Except for Violet&#x2014;the most beautiful of his five wives, whom he married a decade ago at the age of eighty&#x2014;Parks is often alone now. He survived his previous wives and his lone son. He outlived all the racers whose careers he launched, including his friend and fellow war veteran Red Byron, who, despite a leg full of Japanese shrapnel, became NASCAR&#x2019;s first champion. He outlived Bill France, too, his wily friend who presided dictator-like over NASCAR&#x2019;s first quarter century. A handful of racers from the 1940s and &#x2019;50s are still kicking around, but none of the major players from those seminal, post-Depression days before there was a NASCAR. Even Dale Earnhardt, the man who brought NASCAR to the masses, is gone, killed at Daytona in 2001. After abruptly leaving the sport in 1952, Parks watched in awe as NASCAR evolved into something that was unthinkable back in those uneasy years before and after World War II. In the late 1930s, at dusty red-dirt tracks, a victor would be lucky to take home $300 for a win&#x2014;if the promoter didn&#x2019;t run off with the purse. Now, a single NASCAR racing tire costs more than $300, and a win on any given Sunday is worth half a million. Over the years, a few hard-core fans, amateur historians, or magazine writers have tracked Parks down. They stop by to scan his photographs, to tap into his memories of the rowdy races on red-clay tracks, the guns and women and fistfights and white liquor, the days before NASCAR existed. Most days, he works in his office alone, or with Violet by his side. He is the sole living keeper of NASCAR&#x2019;s true history, but his memory is fading, and Violet frets about that. In his tenth decade, Parks&#x2014;the ex-felon, the war veteran, the self- made millionaire and philanthropist&#x2014;has finally begun to slow down. The &#x201c;sport&#x201d; that Parks helped create became a multibillion-dollar industry. It evolved from rural, workingman&#x2019;s domain into an attraction&#x2014;often an obsession&#x2014;for eighty million loyal fans. Today&#x2019;s NASCAR, still owned by a single family, is a phenomenon, a churning moneymaker&#x2014;equal parts Disney, Vegas, and Ringling Brothers&#x2014;and the second most popular sport in America, with races that regularly attract two hundred thousand spectators. No longer a second-tier event on ESPN2, races are now televised nationally on NBC, TNT, and FOX and in 2007 will begin airing on ABC, ESPN, and other networks, part of a TV contract worth nearly $5 billion. With the help of sophisticated merchandising, marketing, and soaring corporate sponsorship, NASCAR continues growing beyond the South, faster than ever, becoming more mainstream by the day. NASCAR&#x2019;s red- white-and-blue logo is splashed on cereal boxes in supermarket aisles, on magazine covers, beer cans, clothing, even leather recliners. Try driving any major highway, even in the Northeast, without seeing NASCAR devotions glued to bumpers. Recent additions to the list of $20-million-a-year race car sponsors include Viagra and, reflective of NASCAR&#x2019;s growing female fan base, Brawny paper towels, Tide, and Betty Crocker. In a sign of NASCAR&#x2019;s relentless hunger for profit, it even rescinded a long-standing ban against liquor sponsors to allow Jack Daniels and Jim Beam to endorse cars in 2005. In 2004, NASCAR&#x2019;s longtime top sponsor&#x2014;cigarette maker R. J. Reynolds, which had been introduced to NASCAR in 1972 by a convicted moonshiner&#x2014;was replaced by communications giant Nextel. That $750- million deal symbolized not only the sport&#x2019;s modern era but the continued decline of the South&#x2019;s ideological dominance of the sport. As Richard Petty has said, &#x201c;NASCAR is no longer a southern sport.&#x201d; Today, NASCAR&#x2019;s fan base has found a happy home in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Dallas, Kansas City, and Chicago. Plans are even afoot for a racetrack near New York City. Most fans are college-educated, middle- aged, middle-class homeowners; nearly half are women. At a time when some pro baseball teams play before paltry crowds of a few thousand, attendance at NASCAR events grows by 10 percent a year. Average attendance at a NASCAR Nextel Cup race is nearly 200,000, three times bigger than the average NFL football game. The sport&#x2019;s stars are millionaire celebrities who appear in rock videos, date supermodels, and live in mansions. When Dale Earnhardt died, millions of Americans wept, as did Parks, who was there that day in 2001 when Earnhardt slammed into the wall at Daytona. The prolonged mourning for Earnhardt&#x2014;the sport&#x2019;s Elvis&#x2014;opened the eyes of more than a few non&#x2013;NASCAR fans. As NASCAR&#x2019;s popularity continues to spread, the sport is becoming a symbol of America itself. But how did NASCAR happen at all? And why? The answers lie in the complicated, whiskey-soaked history of the South. * It&#x2019;s safe to say few of today&#x2019;s NASCAR fans know the name Raymond Parks, nor the monkey named Jocko, the busty pit-road groupies and brash female racers, the moonshining drivers named Fonty, Soapy, Speedy, Smokey, Cannonball, Jap, Cotton, Gober, and Crash. Nor the two intense, freckled friends named Red, one of whom came up with the name NASCAR&#x2014;the &#x201c;National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing&#x201d;&#x2014;and the other of whom became the sport&#x2019;s first champion. And its second. Unlike baseball and football, which celebrate their pioneers and early heroes, most of the dirt-poor southerners who founded stock car racing have died or retired into obscurity. There is no Babe Ruth or Ty Cobb, not even an Abner Doubleday. A few NASCAR names from the 1950s and &#x2019;60s might still resonate among hard-cores: Junior Johnson, Curtis Turner, Fireball Roberts. It&#x2019;s occasionally noted that Richard Petty&#x2019;s father, Lee, and Dale Earnhardt&#x2019;s pop, Ralph, were aggressive, dirt-smeared racing pioneers. But, despite the many books that have proliferated during NASCAR&#x2019;s recent rise to nationwide popularity, the names of Raymond Parks, Red Byron, Red Vogt, Lloyd Seay, and Roy Hall rarely appear in print. Maybe that&#x2019;s because of NASCAR&#x2019;s dirty little secret: moonshine. The sport&#x2019;s distant, whiskey-fueled origins are usually wrapped into a neat, vague little clause&#x2014;&#x201c;. . . whose early racers were bootleggers . . .&#x201d;&#x2014;about as noncommittal to the deeper truth as crediting pigs for their contribution to football. Today, if the fans know anything about NASCAR&#x2019;s origins, they might know the name Bill France. The tall, megaphone-voiced racer/promoter from D.C. deftly managed to get himself named NASCAR&#x2019;s first president in 1947, then eventually bought out the organization&#x2019;s other top officers and stockholders to make himself sole proprietor of a sport that became his personal dynasty. France is often referred to as NASCAR&#x2019;s &#x201c;founder,&#x201d; which is oversimplification bordering on fiction. Largely forgotten from the NASCAR story is this: Bill France used to race for, borrow money, and seek advice from a moonshine baron and convicted felon from Atlanta named Raymond Parks. According to the minutes of the historic 1947 organizational meeting in Daytona Beach at which NASCAR was born, France envisioned an everyman&#x2019;s sport with &#x201c;distinct possibilities for Sunday shows. . . . We don&#x2019;t know how big it can be if it&#x2019;s handled properly.&#x201d; Many people over the years&#x2014;including, right from the start, Raymond Parks and the two Reds&#x2014;have argued that France did not handle things properly. NASCAR certainly succeeded far beyond anyone&#x2019;s wildest postwar expectations, thanks in large part to the moonshiners who were its first and best racers. But France held a deep disdain for the whiskey drivers who nurtured NASCAR&#x2019;s gestation and its early years. He worked hard to distance his sport from those roots and was not above blackballing any dissenters, as Parks and both of the Reds discovered. In striving to create squeaky-clean family entertainment, to the point of downplaying NASCAR&#x2019;s crime-tainted origins, France buried the more dramatic parts of NASCAR&#x2019;s story beneath the all-American mythology he preferred. Efforts to portray stock car racing as a family sport continue to this day. In 2004, Dale Earnhardt Jr. was fined $10,000 for saying &#x201c;shit&#x201d; on national television; he declined to apologize, saying that anyone tuned in to a stock car race shouldn&#x2019;t be surprised by a four-letter word. And in 2006, just before the Daytona 500, NASCAR President Mike Helton told reporters in Washington (Bill France&#x2019;s hometown) that &#x201c;the old Southeastern redneck heritage that we had is no longer in existence.&#x201d; After a backlash from fans, Helton backpedaled, saying NASCAR was &#x201c;proud of where we came from.&#x201d; Despite the lip service, in its reach to a wider audience, NASCAR seems to be losing its vernacular and, in the words of The Washington Post, &#x201c;shedding its past as if it were an embarrassing family secret.&#x201d; Bill France, for better or worse, commandeered stock car racing, declared himself its king, appropriated its coffers and history, leaving the real but untidy story behind. He transformed an unruly hobby into a monopoly, then rewrote the past. This book, therefore, is the previously untold story of how Raymond Parks, his moonshining cousins, and their four-letter-word-using friends from the red-dirt hills of North Georgia helped create the sport that Bill France ultimately made his own. In the South, where the Great Depression infected deeper and festered longer than elsewhere, there were few escape routes. Folks couldn&#x2019;t venture into the city for a baseball game or a movie because there weren&#x2019;t enough cities, transportation was limited, and the smaller towns rarely had a theater. There were no big-time sports, either (the Braves wouldn&#x2019;t settle in Atlanta until 1965, and the Falcons a year later). It was all cotton fields, unemployed farmers, and Depression-silenced mills, mines, and factories. But if you were lucky enough to have a nearby fairgrounds or an enterprising farmer who&#x2019;d turned his barren field into a racetrack, maybe you&#x2019;d have had a chance to stand beside a chicken-wire fence and watch Lloyd Seay in his jacked-up Ford V-8 tearing around the oval, a symbol of power for the powerless. But Seay&#x2019;s racing career would get violently cut short by his moonshining career, and World War II would interrupt the entire sport&#x2019;s progression for nearly five years. It wasn&#x2019;t until after the war that southern racing, helped by an unlikely hero with a war-crippled leg, regained its footing and momentum. The rough, violent years of 1945 through 1950 would then unfold as the most outrageous years of NASCAR&#x2019;s colorful history. For those who were a part of it, who saw it and felt it, it was incredible. * This is not a book about NASCAR. It&#x2019;s the story of what happened in Atlanta, in Daytona Beach, and a handful of smaller southern towns before and after World War II. It&#x2019;s the story of what happened when moonshine and the automobile collided, and how puritanical Henry Ford and the forces of Prohibition and war all inadvertently helped the southern moonshiners and their gnarly sport. NASCAR historians can tell you who led every lap of every race since the organization&#x2019;s first official contest was won in 1948 by a man named Red Byron. But they can&#x2019;t&#x2014;or won&#x2019;t&#x2014;say much about what happened in the decade before that. If Abner Doubleday allegedly invented baseball and James Naismith created basketball with peach baskets and soccer balls at a YMCA, then who created NASCAR? The answer: a bunch of motherless, dirt-poor southern teens driving with the devil in jacked-up Fords full of corn whiskey. Because long before there were stock cars, there were Ford V-8 whiskey cars&#x2014;the best means of escape a southern boy could wish for.</p><h2>Each New Day: 365 Reflections to Strengthen Your Faith</h2><p>Now with a new foreword by Brother Andrew, <i>Each New Day </i>is a collection of short yet profound devotions for every day of the year from the heart of Corrie ten Boom.

Your own Bible is probably included in the cover-up!</p><p>In this book, which includes a study guide for personal or group use, John MacArthur unveils the essential and clarifying revelation that may be keeping you from a fulfilling&#x2015;and correct&#x2015;relationship with God. It&#x2019;s powerful. It&#x2019;s controversial. And with new eyes you&#x2019;ll see the riches of your salvation in a radically new way. </p><p>What does it mean to be a Christian the way Jesus defined it? MacArthur says it all boils down to one word:</p><p>&nbsp;SLAVE</p><p></p><p>&#x201c;We have been bought with a price. We belong to Christ. We are His own possession.&#x201d;</p><p>Endorsements:</p><p>"Dr. John MacArthur is never afraid to tell the truth and in this book he does just that. The Christian's great privilege is to be the slave of Christ. Dr. MacArthur makes it clear that this is one of the Bible's most succinct ways of describing our discipleship. This is a powerful exposition of Scripture, a convincing corrective to shallow Christianity, a masterful work of pastoral encouragement...a devotional classic." &nbsp;- Dr. R. Albert Mohler, President, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>"John MacArthur expertly and lucidly explains that Jesus frees us from bondage into a royal slavery that we might be His possession. Those who would be His children must, paradoxically, be willing to be His slaves." &nbsp;- Dr. R.C. Sproul</p>"Dr. John MacArthur's teaching on 'slavery' resonates in the deepest recesses of my 'inner-man.' As an African-American pastor, I have been there. That is why the thought of someone writing about slavery as being a 'God-send' was the most ludicrous, unconscionable thing that I could have ever imagined...until I read this book. Now I see that becoming a slave is a biblical command, completely redefining the idea of freedom in Christ. I don't want to simply be a 'follower' or even just a 'servant'...but a 'slave'." &nbsp;- The Rev. Dr. Dallas H. Wilson, &nbsp;Jr., Vicar, St. John's Episcopal Chapel, Charleston, SC</p><p><p>John MacArthur has served as pastor-teacher of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California, since 1969.

She lives with her family in Brooklyn, New York.The summer before D Foster&#x2019;s real mama came and took her away, Tupac wasn&#x2019;t dead yet. He&#x2019;d been shot five times&#x2014;two in the head, two down by his leg and thing and one shot that went in his hand and came out the other side and went through a vein or something. All the doctors were saying he should have died and were bringing other doctors up to his room to show everybody what a medical miracle he was. That&#x2019;s what they called him. A Medical Miracle. Like he wasn&#x2019;t even a real person. Like he was just something to be looked at and turned this way and that way and poked at. Like he wasn&#x2019;t Tupac.<br><br>D Foster showed up a few months before Tupac got shot that first time and left us the summer before he died. By the time her mama came and got her and she took one last walk on out of our lives, I felt like we&#x2019;d grown up and grown old and lived a hundred lives in those few years that we knew her. But we hadn&#x2019;t really. We&#x2019;d just gone from being eleven to being thirteen. Three girls. Three the Hard Way. In the end, it was just me and Neeka again.<br><br>The first time Tupac got shot, it was November 1994. Cold as anything everywhere in the city and me, Neeka, D and everybody else was shivering our behinds through the winter with nobody thinking Pac was gonna make it. Then, right after he had some surgery, he checked himself out of the hospital even though the doctors was trying to tell him he wasn&#x2019;t well enough to be doing that. That&#x2019;s when everybody around here started talking about what a true gangsta he was. At least that&#x2019;s what all the kids were thinking. The churchgoing people just kept saying he had God with him. Some of the parents were saying what they&#x2019;d always been saying about him&#x2014;that he was heading right to what he got because he was a bad example for kids, especially black kids like us. Crazy stuff about Tupac being a disgrace to the race and blah, blah, blah. The wannabe gangsta kids just kept saying Tupac was gonna get revenge on whoever did that to him.<br><br>But when I saw Tupac like that&#x2014;coming out of the hospital, all skinny and small-looking in that wheelchair, big guards around him&#x2014;I remember thinking, <i>He ain&#x2019;t gonna try to get revenge on nobody and he ain&#x2019;t trying to be a disgrace to anybody either. Just trying to keep on</i>. Even though he wasn&#x2019;t smiling, I knew he was just happy and confused about still being alive.<br><br>Went on like that all winter long, then February came and they sent Tupac to jail for some dumb stuff and people started talking about that&#x2014;the negative peeps talking about that&#x2019;s where he needed to be and all the rest of us saying how messed up the law was when you didn&#x2019;t look and act like people thought you should.<br><br>Spring came and Pac dropped his album from prison and this one song on it was real tight, so we all just listened to it and talked about how bad-ass Pac was&#x2014;that he wasn&#x2019;t even gonna let being in jail stop him from making his music. Me and Neeka and D had all turned twelve by then, but we still believed stuff&#x2014;like that we&#x2019;d grow up and marry beautiful rapper guys who&#x2019;d buy us huge houses out in the country. We talked about how they&#x2019;d be all crazy over us and if some other girl walked by who was fine or something, they wouldn&#x2019;t even turn their heads to look because they&#x2019;d be so in love with us and all. Stupid stuff like that.<br><br>In jail, Pac started getting clear about thug life, saying it wasn&#x2019;t the right thing. He got all <i>righteous</i> about it and whatnot, and with all the rappers shooting on each other and stuff, it wasn&#x2019;t hard to agree with him.<br><br>Time kept passing on that way. Things and people changing. First, D turned thirteen, then me and Neeka were right there behind her&#x2014;us all turning into teenagers, getting body, getting tall, boys acting stupid over us.<br><br>Seems soon as we started settling into all that changing, D&#x2019;s mama came&#x2014;took her away from us.<br><br>And time kept on creeping.<br><br>Then Tupac went and died and it got me thinking about D. About the short time she was with us and about how you could know somebody real good but not know them at the same time. And it made me want to remember. Yeah, I guess that&#x2019;s it. I guess that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m trying to do now. . . .</p><h2>Encyclopedia of Origami Techniques, The: The complete, fully illustrated guide to the folded paper arts</h2><p>A valuable, fully illustrated guide to the folded-paper arts, <i>The Encyclopedia of Origami Techniques&nbsp;</i>provides the reader with&nbsp;easy-to-follow instructions for creating their own paper sculptures.

Chrissie Astell is a well-known angel workshop facilitator, appearing frequently on TV and radio and in spiritual magazines. She is the author of several books and card oracle sets, including Gifts from Angels and The Angel Insight Pack.Although not a complete beginner in Origami im certainly not a master and I found lots in this book of interest and easy enough to try. The book is divided into sections Getting started, basic techniques, beginner projects, intermediate projects, challenging projects and origami from around the world. The beginner section has some unusual ones like rocking nun and a very nice 10 point star, the intermediate has a really nice square bear and several boxes including an unusual open cube box, the challenging projects has a great double cube and some fun twisted paper designs which I will have to work up to. The origami from around the world is a gallery of photos which are great inspiration, I think this is a book I will come back to but definately the square bear is on my list of ones I want to do. * Frances Darvill * I found this book really useful in learning origami as a beginner and the instructions are very clear. The book starts with a section discussing types of paper, folding tips, and a very detailed explanation of the folding methods and symbols. The projects are grouped into 3 sections for beginners, intermediates and more challenging projects, and each project comes with informational text, tips and challenges. After the instructional sections, there are 25 pages of origami models from around the world, which are absolutely stunning. The book ends with a glossary of the terms used, which is really useful. * Susie Wilkinson * Superb book! The photos and pictures are so clear and concise for even the most thick fingered of us to give this a go. The diagrams are so easy to follow and a complete novice could master the first folds. A must for anyone starting out with Origami or a Christmas present for a creative type. So descriptive and beautifully illustrated. * Will Tunnicliffe * Good clear instructions for the beginner. A lot of different animals, boxes and shapes.Nicely laid out and interesting read. * Ruth Boyd * As a complete beginner to origami this book is an essential resource for understanding the basics and starting to produce projects. The instructions and supporting diagrams are very clear and easy to understand and there are photographs of the finished projects. This book would also be suitable for those who have some experience with origami and would like to refresh their skills as well as those that are more experienced as there are also intermediate and advanced projects to try. I would highly recommend this wonderful book. * Helen Lyn * As a beginner to the world of Origami, I found this book really useful! The illustrations throughout are wonderful and clear. The first part helps you to get started with detailed information about types of paper available for this hobby and moves on to explain the folding techniques required. Next there are three sections for different levels of ability which you can progress through whilst referring back to the basic folds as required! A lovely addition to your craft library that can be dipped into for different occasions!The Encyclopedia of Origami Techniques: The Complete, Fully Illustrated Guide to the Folded Paper Arts * Lynn Neal * I found this a fun and informative book. The steps are easy to follow and once you&#39;ve mastered these the basic shapes move on to more complicated ones which is a great way to develop your skills. My favourite is the peacock. If you&#39;re looking to start origami this is a book to choose. * Marian Carr * I was sent this book to give my honest opinion about it and this is what I am doing. As a new person to this sort of craft I found the book quite difficult to follow and some of the illustrations were a little complicated too. This is definitely not a book for beginners even though some of the techniques are for beginners. * Linda Truswell * Designs a little dated and nothing really inspiring. Don&#39;t get me wrong a great book for learning but I did not immediately find something I had to make. The usual how to section describing the different folds. Beginners to intermediate folds with a section at the back showing real professional makes. The soft cover is annoying as it kept closing when I was folding so I kept losing the page and where I was. Overall a good book that needs some modern makes. * Caire Newman *</p><h2>Manifesto: A Revolutionary Approach to General Aviation Maintenance</h2><p><p><i>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a dirty little secret about aviation maintenance: it often breaks aircraft instead of fixing them.&#x201d;</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Manifesto&#x201d; is the much-anticipated first book from renowned aviation columnist and speaker Mike Busch.

Rather than relying on personal stories and ideas alone, <i>Grandparenting with Grace</i> seeks to explain from Scripture the "what," "why," "who," and "how" of grandparenting.</p> <p>Readers hungry to know more about God's calling for this role will find inspiration, encouragement, and gospel hope.

There's often little thought given to the idea of intentionally and spiritually pouring into grandchildren.</p> <p>McCall urges readers to look at grandparenting from an eternal perspective, considering how to be involved in their families in God-honoring ways. By applying biblical wisdom, grandparents can also strengthen the local church as they continue to see and pursue God's calling to present the gospel to the coming generations.</p></p><p><p>Larry E.

But by the time most Christians become grandparents, they have also started to give thought to finishing well as follow�ers of Jesus.

Filled with practical action steps, <em>Grandparenting with Grace </em>ought to be in every grandparent&#x2019;s toolbox for building a legacy worth outliving you generation to generation.&#x201d; <br><strong>Cavin T. Harper</strong>, Founder and President, The Christian Grandparenting Network</p> <p>&#x201c;I found out my daughter was pregnant with our first grandchild a week before reading <em>Grandparenting with Grace</em>. I thought I was excited before, but after reading Larry McCall&#x2019;s book, my vision for grandparenting and excitement for my new role went off the charts. Larry has hit the sweet spot; he both inspires you in your role as a grandparent and gives you the practical steps you need to succeed. If you are a grandparent or soon will be, you should read this book.&#x201d; <br><strong>Marty Machowski</strong>, Pastor; author of <em>The Gospel Story Bible, The Ology </em>(a theology book for children), <em>Long Story Short: Ten-Minute Devotions to Draw Your Family to God, Parenting First Aid</em>, and other gospel-rich resources for families and churches</p> <p>&#x201c;Being a grandparent is a wonderful privilege. It includes most of the joys of parenthood without some of the difficult challenges. Though multiple resources are available for parents seeking wisdom for godly parenting, advice for grandparents is practi�cally nonexistent. This is a book every grandparent should read. It is refreshingly grounded in the gospel, essential for guidance in our relationships with our grandchildren, and is also filled with practical tips. If you are a grandparent, do not wait to profit from this invaluable resource.&#x201d; <br><strong>Tom Julien</strong>, Former Executive Director of Encompass World Partners</p> <p>&#x201c;Our grandchildren are gifts from God. With that gift, there is an enormous responsibility for grandparents to help nurture their grandchildren&#x2019;s love for the Lord and their spiritual growth. Larry shows us how a gospel-centered lifestyle combined with intentional prayer play a key role for grandparents. In this practi�cal, Scripture-based book, you will gain tools to remember the great purpose God has given you in this role and bless the genera�tions that come after you.&#x201d; <br><strong>Lillian Penner</strong>, Author of <em>Grandparenting with a Purpose: Effective Ways to Pray for Your Grandchildren</em>; co-director for the prayer ministry of Christian Grandparenting Network</p> <p>&#x201c;Our actions affect not only our personal lives but the lives of our children and grandchildren. It&#x2019;s a joy to live in light of the gospel, but it&#x2019;s an even greater joy to see the light of the gospel change those closest to you. Time and time again, Larry McCall writes and teaches with powerful and practical application. As a grandparent of thirteen, this is a book I have been waiting for!&#x201d; <br><strong>Byron Paulus, </strong>President, Life Action Ministries</p> <p>&#x201c;As an author and grandparent, Larry McCall has so many practical ideas and challenges for the parents of the parents. For all who get to love and provide fun and wisdom for their grandkids, <em>Grandpar�enting with Grace </em>offers insight ranging from the use of technology, ways to make memories together, and how to bless them in little but life-changing ways. Every mama and papa thinks about how their kids grow up so quickly. This manual of suggestions should be provided right away, every time a grandchild is born.&#x201d; <br><strong>Knute Larson</strong>, Grandparent; pastoral coach</p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be mistaken. This book is not about how to give grace to your grandchildren. It&#x2019;s about how to be full of grace as a grand�parent, which is much better and far more powerful. It&#x2019;s what makes this book so good.&#x201d; <br><strong>Jack Klumpenhower</strong>, Author of <em>Show Them Jesus</em></p> <p>&#x201c;I thank God for Larry McCall and for this book that inspires, challenges, and equips us with biblical vision and practical guid�ance for making known to our children&#x2019;s children &#x2018;the glorious deeds of the Lord and his might and the wonders he has done.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br><strong>David Michael</strong>, Cofounder of Truth78 (formerly Children Desiring God); pastor for the Next Generations, College Park Church, Indianapolis</p> <p>&#x201c;Who would&#x2019;ve imagined that a sound, systematic, and practical theology of <em>Grandparenting with Grace </em>would ever be available in print? Well, thankfully, Larry McCall has now written such an important manual for us! And, in doing so, has literally left no stone unturned in addressing this vital, yet neglected, area of Christian living. His over four decades of solid marriage and parenting experience (he has many children and grandchildren), along with almost four decades of faithful pastoral ministry, make this book a veritable source of grandparenting wisdom. This is an important tool for discipling your family until you see Jesus!&#x201d; <br><strong>Jerry Marcellino</strong>, Preaching Pastor of Audubon Drive Bible Church in Laurel, Mississippi; cofounder of FIRE (The Fellowship of Independent Reformed Evangelicals)</p> <p>&#x201c;Biblically-grounded, gospel-centered, thoughtful, practical, reflec�tive, and intentional are just a few descriptions that come to mind when thinking about this outstanding new resource designed for grandparents who desire to serve their families and make a differ�ence in the lives of their grandchildren. This well-designed book, which includes helpful questions and action steps at the conclusion of each chapter, will be beneficial for many, whether read individu�ally or studied in a small group setting. It provides a wonderful reminder of the special calling and responsibilities that come with grandparenting, including the relationships with grandchildren and their parents, in both good times and in moments of challenge. Larry McCall is to be commended for putting together this most applicable volume.&#x201d; <br><strong>David S. Dockery</strong>, President, Trinity International University/Trinity Evangelical Divinity School</p> <p>&#x201c;This book is a must-read for grandparents. Every season of life could use gospel-centered counsel. With the grace of a pastor, the insight of a theologian, and the love of a gospel-filled grand�parent, Larry has given us just that. Make sure you get an extra copy for your friends; they will love you for it and so will their grandchildren.&#x201d; <br><strong>Louis C.

"I CAN'T DO IT!" she shouts, expressing the frustration all of us feel when we try and fail. Will she ever be "smart" like her sister? Maybe she isn't smart at all.<br><br>Luckily Sophie's teacher steps in. What does it mean to be smart? Using current, popular "mindset" techniques, Sophie's class is taught that we get smarter when we exercise our brains, such as when we work harder at solving a puzzle. Struggling to solve a problem doesn't mean "I can't do it!" Sophie and her classmates just can't do it... yet! <br><br>Readers will cheer when Sophie finally prevails, and at the end of the day, she's confident and optimistic. At home, Sophie uses her new technique to help her dad solve a carpentry puzzle.<br><br>In this third book about Sophie, Molly Bang again helps children deal with a challenging everyday issue, providing an opening to ask: What do you do when you think, "I can't!"?</p><p>Everybody faces problems<br><br>that seem impossible to<br><br>solve.

It reveals one of our deepest and most painful conditions&#x2014;not having a sense of belonging. However, Alan Graham, founder of Mobile Loaves &amp; Fishes and Community First! Village, is improving the quality of life for a large quantity of people through sharing his personal story of becoming more human through humanizing others. Graham believes the more we can give people dignity, the power of choice, and genuine community, the better we&#x2019;ll be able to offer solutions that will have impact on the world at large. And while his missionary work is focused on giving a home to the physically homeless, he also wants to transform the lives of every living person by shifting the paradigm in understanding what it means to be &#x201c;home.&#x201d; In <em>Welcome Homeless</em>, Graham delves deep into what it means to be connected to God, the earth, and each other. In doing so, he shows us the home we&#x2019;ve all longed for but never had.</p><p><em>Welcome Homeless</em> is about becoming fully human by being fully present. It is about finally connecting with the disconnected and finding our identity through knowing the true identity of others. Graham wants to engrain the human story in you so deeply that you start being who you were made to be&#x2014;that you start finally being like the image from which you were made and start empathizing instead of sympathizing with the people around you. Similar to how we can become 100 percent fully human by mimicking the ultimate image, we can shape a better world by mimicking the picture of the new heaven and the new earth&#x2014;a picture that has reality at the heart of it but is beyond our imagination. Alan Graham also shares his personal story, the stories of the homeless, and the stories of those whose worldviews have been shifted by the homeless. Because of his raw, humorous, and honest voice, he achieves a rare and profound universality. Houses become homes once they embody the stories of the people who have made these spaces into places of significance, meaning, and memory. Home is fundamentally a place of connection and of relationships that are life-giving and foundational. Graham invites you to make everyone feel truly at home by finally inviting those living on the fringes of society into your heart.</p><p>This is why <em>Welcome Homeless</em> is about doing, not saying. It is about taking the ultimate and forward-thinking vision of a new heaven and new earth and literally breaking the soil so that new earth can exist here today. It is about realizing that homelessness is not fundamentally a consequence of moral and spiritual inadequacies; but rather it is often the logical and economical outcome for a large part of our population.</p><p>So, what does your vision of humanity and love look like? Whatever the vision, it should look like community. People should feel more alive after they meet you. When your consciousness changes from one of self-absorption to a consciousness aware of its human desire for connection, compassion, kindness, and beauty, you will start seeing things differently&#x2014;and others will start seeing you made anew as well because the absolute greatest self-help occurs when you help others</p></p><p><p>Alan Graham is the president, CEO, and founder of Mobile Loaves &amp; Fishes, a social profit enterprise that delivers meals and provides homes to homeless people on the streets of Austin, San Antonio, New Orleans, Nashville, Minneapolis, Providence, and New Bedford.&nbsp;</p> <p>Alan was born in Houston in 1955. He grew up in Alvin, Texas and attended the College of Mainland and later the University of Texas. In 1978 he left UT to begin a career in real estate. He was a partner in many of Central Texas&#x2019; most successful real estate development projects. In the mid-1990s, Alan co-founded the Lynxs Group, which built the air cargo facility at Austin&#x2019;s new airport in 1997, and went on to build similar facilities at airports around the country.&nbsp;</p> <p>Alan left the Lynxs Group in 1997 and managed Austin&#x2019;s cargo port as the new airport was opening. At the same time, Alan had the seed of the idea for Mobile Loaves &amp; Fishes. He and the other founders started by making sack lunches and serving them from the back of a green minivan.

Imam Ghazali argues that just as there is an end to this noble objective there is also a beginning to it, which must be made firm for one to achieve success. He then goes on to expound the fundamentals of this "beginning." While being concise and to-the-point the manual is laid out in the form of a detailed daily timetable providing the reader strong inspiration and much heart-rending counsel. The three sections of this book are on obedience, refraining from disobedience, and the etiquette of companionship with the Creator and with creation. One of Im?m Ghaz?l?'s final works, it embodies a lifetime of learning, experience, and spirituality and can be taken as an introduction to his larger works. This translation published for the first time with facing Arabic text also includes many notes and transliteration for the supplications contained within. "An excellent translation of an important book on the fundamentals of Muslim piety and etiquette. With an accessible English translation alongside the original Arabic text, this introductory work will be useful for readers interested in exploring the realities of Islamic piety, students of Arabic and educators alike."

As Kenzie and Gennaro learn, however, this crime is no ordinary theft. It's about justice, about right and wrong. But in Boston, finding the truth isn't just a dirty business . . . it's deadly. </p></p><p><p>Dennis Lehane is the author of ten previous novels&#x2014;including the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Live by Night; Moonlight Mile; Gone, Baby, Gone; Mystic River; Shutter Island</em>; and <em>The Given Day</em>&#x2014;as well as <em>Coronado</em>, a collection of short stories and a play. He lives in California with his family.</p>Patrick Kenzie is a Dorchester, Mass., boy born and bred. Now, working out of a church belfry as a private detective (along with partner Angela Gennaro, who has been his best friend since childhood and suffers at the hands of an abusive husband), he is hired by a senator to locate some papers reportedly stolen by an African-American (the senator uses a less polite term) cleaning woman. When the woman is gunned down in downtown Boston, it becomes clear that the materials in her possession were not the government documents the senator had claimed. The sure pacing, humor, and clear sense of place are unusually strong for a debut novel. Lehane's depictions of working-class Dorchester and the great divide between its Irish-American and African-American inhabitants are so on-target the reader could practically use them as a map and drive right into town. Even better are the descriptions of local foibles. Kenzie recounts that a friend had once been successful at removing a Denver boot (a clamp, which makes it impossible to move a car, placed around a car's tire after too many traffic tickets) and was downhearted to find that it was a fluke and that he would not be ``making more money than Michael Jackson.'' There is a lot of gun play here, and plenty of other violence too. Not only does Gennaro regularly come into work with black eyes, but Kenzie also recalls his firefighter father, a man whom he sarcastically refers to as ``the Hero,'' but who was brutal in his own home. A lively debut about residents of the Boston metropolitan area who don't summer in Hyannisport. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

They aren&#x2019;t engaged in class. Getting them to talk is like pulling teeth. Whatever the situation, your reality is not meeting your expectations. Change is needed. But who&#x2019;s got the time? Or maybe you&#x2019;re just starting out, and you want to get it right the first time. If so, Teaching College: The Ultimate Guide to Lecturing, Presenting, and Engaging Students is the blueprint. Written for early career instructors, this easy-to-implement guide teaches you to: � Think like advertisers to understand your target audience&#x2014;your students � Adopt the active learning approach of the best K-12 teachers � Write a syllabus that gets noticed and read � Develop lessons that stimulate deep engagement � Create slide presentations that students can digest � Get students to do the readings, participate more, and care about your course Secrets like &#x201c;focusing on students, not content&#x201d; and building a &#x201c;customer&#x201d; profile of the class will change the way you teach. The author, Dr. Norman Eng, argues that much of these approaches and techniques have been effectively used in marketing and K-12 education, two industries that could greatly improve how college instructors teach. Find out how to hack the world of college classrooms and have your course become the standard by which all other courses will be measured against. Whether you are an adjunct, a lecturer, an assistant professor, or even a graduate assistant, pedagogical success is within your grasp.</p><p>Norman Eng is a doctor of education (Ed.D.) with a background in teaching and marketing&#x2014;two areas that relate to lecturing, presenting, and engaging audiences. As a marketing executive, he worked with clients to realize their communication goals in the pharmaceutical, insurance, pet, and retail industries. Norman learned one major lesson, something he discusses in his book &#x201c;Teaching College.&#x201d; He applied this lesson to his teaching as a public school elementary school teacher in the early- to mid-2000s, where he was nominated as one of Honor Roll&#x2019;s Outstanding American Teachers. As an adjunct assistant professor for local colleges in the City University of New York system, Norman realized that much of what he gained as a marketer and as an elementary school teacher held true for college instructors: Students&#x2014;whether undergraduate or graduate&#x2014;need to see the value of what you are teaching to their lives. With consistently high student and departmental evaluations in two separate colleges every semester, Dr. Eng hopes to share what he has gained so far from these three industries&#x2014;marketing, K&#x2013;12 education, and higher education&#x2014;with the larger community of higher education instructors, whether they are graduate students, adjunct lecturers, assistant professors, or beyond."Fairly new to teaching?

It's easy to read, peppered with great tips, action steps, and illustrative videos, and brimming with ways to make your course and course materials personally relevant and interesting to your students."<br>- <b>LINDA B. NILSON, </b>Director Emeritus, Office of Teaching Effectiveness and Innovation, Clemson University, and author of <i>Teaching at its Best</i><br>&nbsp;<br>"Dr. Eng tackles one of the biggest problems facing higher education: so few professors are adept at the art of teaching. Dr. Eng provides sound strategies for improving professors' communication of ideas, student engagement, and actual student learning. I found the writing style to be bothinviting and enjoyable.

Highly recommended."<br>- <b>GWENDOLYN METTETAL</b>, Director, University Center for Excellence in Teaching (UCET), Indiana University South Bend<br>&nbsp;<br>"What a fantastic book! As someone who has taught in K-12 and college classrooms, I have often lamented the fact that K-12 teachers get so much preparation in the skills of teaching, while those at the college level get none. In&nbsp;<i>Teaching College</i>, Norman Eng closes that gap brilliantly, synthesizing education and marketing into a fresh approach that will significantly change the way college classes are taught worldwide. You will find useful insights and practical, actionable tips on every page, and all of it written in an approachable, conversational style. A must for anyone who teaches at the college level."<br><b>- JENNIFER GONZALEZ</b>, Editor-in-Chief at&nbsp;<i>Cult of Pedagogy</i><br>&nbsp;<br>"Dr. Eng has created an accessible, evidence based guide to effective college instruction that will be particularly valuable for relatively new faculty members who are coming out of graduate programs where there were limited opportunities to teach.&nbsp; He provides practical guidance and anticipates and responds to the numerous challenges all instructors face. This is a very valuable resource, and I encourage its widespread use."<br>- <b>DAVID H. MONK</b>, Dean, College of Education, Penn State University<br><br>"This book is an excellent source for instructors who would like to take their first steps toward including interactive and hands-on work in their classes, which when done effectively can powerfully shape student learning.

With clear and simple wisdom, Deepak Chopra explores the full meaning of wealth consciousness and presents a step-by-step plan for creating affluence and fulfillment on all levels of our lives. <br>According to the author, affluence is our natural state, and the entire physical universe with all its abundance is the offspring of an unbounded, limitless field of all possibilities. Through a series of simple steps and everyday actions, Creating Affluence gently fosters the wealth consciousness needed to tap into this field and create anything you desire.</p><p>DEEPAK CHOPRA is the bestselling author of numerous books including Ageless Body, Timeless Mind, Creating Affluence, Quantum Healing, Unconditional Life, Perfect Health, and Return of the Rishi. His groundbreaking lectures and books blend physics and philosophy, the practical and the spiritual, venerable Eastern wisdom and cutting-edge Western science with dynamic results."Affluence is the experience in which our needs are easily met and our desires spontaneously fulfilled," says one of our kindest authorities on living in harmony with the universe. We can create this experience not through effort or struggle but through simply becoming aware of the intelligence that is everywhere. It's an intelligence that can transform every moment of our existence and direct us to the work and abundance we are meant to have. It's an elusive idea for Westerners but one Chopra makes exceptionally inviting. This is one of his most accessible and useful audios, brief enough for daily listening that can shift your awareness and your activities to the abundance you deserve.

Since then others have been written, but no other book on the subject contains more examples of stretching exercises, or is able to take detailed anatomical information and present it in a way that is easy for everyone to understand. This is where The Anatomy of Stretching is different: it is able to take you inside the body and show you both the primary and secondary muscles in action during the stretching process. The Anatomy of Stretching looks at stretching from every angle, including: physiology and flexibility; the benefits of stretching; the different types of stretching; rules for safe stretching; and how to stretch properly. Aimed at fitness enthusiasts of any level, as well as fitness pros, The Anatomy of Stretching also focuses on which stretches are useful for the alleviation or rehabilitation of specific sports injuries. Plus in this second edition, over twenty new stretches have been added; the chapter on physiology has been expanded; more detailed anatomy has been included with each stretching chapter; the top five stretches for a range of sports and sports injuries are listed; and a new numbering system has been included to help reference each stretch.</p><p>Brad Walker is an internationally recognized stretching and sports injury consultant with over twenty years of practical experience in the health and fitness industry.

That God reigns supreme in Heaven, is generally conceded; that He does so over this world, is almost universally denied-if not directly, then indirectly. More and more are men in their philosophizing and theorizing, relegating God to the background. Take the material realm. Not only is it denied that God created everything, by personal and direct action, but few believe that He has any immediate concern in regulating the works of His own hands. Everything is supposed to be ordered according to the (impersonal and abstract) &#34;laws of Nature&#34;. Thus is the Creator banished from His own creation. Therefore we need not be surprised that men, in their degrading conceptions, exclude Him from the realm of human affairs.</p><p>Pink answers a host of questions that have remained unresolved in the minds of many Christians.

Ask Dad.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve asked Dad!&#x201d; I cried. &#x201c;He told me to ask you!&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; said Mom, taking another look at the poster. &#x201c;Well . . . &#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Please,&#x201d; I begged. &#x201c;<br> Wouldn&#x2019;t you rather go to a vampire carnival?&#x201d; asked Dad. &#x201c;I used to love going to vampire carnivals with my friends when I was a young boy. All those spooky rides lit by flickering candles in the dead of night. And delicious red food. My favorite ride was the coffin blaster.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Or we could go to a fairy carnival,&#x201d; suggested Mom quickly. &#x201c;Fairy carnivals are lovely. All full of flowers and beautiful nature. I used to like going on the little flower-cup ride with my friends.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Pfft!&#x201d; said Dad. &#x201c;The coffin blaster is much more exciting!&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;But not as pretty,&#x201d; pointed out Mom. <br> &#x201c;Oh, but I really, really would like to go to the Carnival Spectacular,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s only open next weekend. Please can we go? I promise I&#x2019;ll clean my whole bedroom!&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; said Mom. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll think about it.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Death of Superman (New Edition)</h2><p>THE EPIC EVENT THAT SHOCKED A NATION AND CHANGED SUPERMAN FOREVER!<br><br>Doomsday.

However the information given is still relevant and useful and at this price, you cannot expect more. This book includes all the information you need to create stunning silk flowers, including framing your work. The Bouquet of Roses is my favourite. * Karen Platt Yarnsandfabrics.co.uk/crafts * October 2014 I learned ribbon embroidery with this book and went on to teach classes and make various embroidered items using this lovely method. First published in 1998 this is one of the Classics range of stand out titles that belong firmly on every crafter&#39;s keeper shelf. This is a user-friendly primer that gets you started right away before pictures of advanced work and worse still, what you might have to buy can frighten you. Fortunately that mostly means ribbons, embroidery floss, a hoop and if you want to stencil or paint backgrounds materials for this, otherwise there is no large outlay before you can start. Learn how to anchor ribbon and the special stitch unique to ribbon embroidery plus a few other adaptations of freestyle stitches and before long you will be working on your first picture, a study of spring flowers. If you have done some embroidery before you will find it easier as you have already learned much of what you need to know, but even if you haven&#39;t expect clear photographs and captions guide you through the process. Why is this book a classic? I have several other books on the subject but none is so obviously aimed at the beginner, and with a subject that has not had a lot of coverage (especially back in 1998) this is essential. It literally takes you from choosing the ribbon through practising the stitches to making several small, simple but beautiful pieces. If you are at all interested in having a go and don&#39;t already own this book do buy it. Very highly recommended. * Myshelf.com *</p><h2>When Someone You Love is Depressed: How to Help Your Loved One Without Losing Yourself</h2><p>Many books have been written for those suffering from depression, but what if you're suffering becuase someone you love is depressed? Research shows that if you are close to a depressed person, you are at a much higher risk of developing problems yourself, including anxiety, phobias, and even a kind of contagious depression. <br> In this authoritative and compassionate book, psychologists Laura Epstein Rosen and Cavier Francisco Amador explain the mechanisms of depression that can cause communication breakdown, increase hostility, and ultimately destroy relationships. Through compelling real-life stories and step-by-step advice, the authors teach concrete methods that you and your loved one can use to protect yourselves and your relationship from depression's impact. Drawing on their own innovative research, the give sensitive guidance about how to recognize your needs, how to provide the best kind of support, and how to encourage the depressed person to seek treatment. Whether you are the partner, parent, friend, or child of a depressed person, you'll find this book and invaluable companion in you journey back to health.</p><p><b>Praise for<br> <i>When Someone You Love Is Depressed</i>:</b> <p> "Insidious and, in its fashion, communicable, depression is an ailment of underappreciated destructive power. Doctors Rosen and Amador perform a valuable service by posing the important question: How do you cope with depression when it intrudes on an intimate relationship? Their answers contain practical wisdom that will allow readers to make concrete decisions affecting their own well-being and that of someone they love."<br> -- Peter Kramer, author of <i>Listening to Prozac</i> </p><p> "This is the first book to detail the effect of depression on relationships and to offer concrete, clear advice on how to help a depressed person. It is a remarkably balanced, well-written, and encouraging piece of work that will undoubtedly help millions of people and become an invaluable resource."<br> -- Jack M. Gorman, M.D., author of <i>The Essential Guide to Psychiatric Drugs</i> and <i>The New Psychiatry</i> </p><p> </p> <p> Although numerous books have been written for those suffering from depression, until now none of them has addressed the "secondary" victims of this debilitating disease: the loved ones of the depressed. If someone you love is depressed, you undoubtedly recognize that the depression has placed some new burdens on you; however you may be affected in more ways than you realize. Research shows that if you are close to a depressed person, you are at a much higher risk of developing problems yourself, including anxiety, phobias, and even a kind of contagious depression. Yet, too often, those of us who care about a depressed person are so focused on their needs that we don't realize that we might need help. There is startling evidence that marriages in which one person is depressed are nine times more likely to end in divorce; that children with a depressed parent are at an increased risk for a range of adjustment difficulties; and that if you are caring for an elderly depressed parent, your physical and mental health are likely to suffer. </p><p> Depression is also notorious for causing increased misunderstandings and sexual problems in intimate relationships. Laura Rosen and Xavier Amador, psychologists with expertise in treating the secondary victims of depression, explain the mechanisms of depression that can cause communication breakdown, increase hostility, and ultimately destroy relationships. Rather than just explaining these secondary effects of depression, the authors teach you concrete methods that you and your loved one can use to protect yourselves and your relationship from depression's impact. </p><p> Through compelling real life stories and step-by-step advice, Rosen and Amador show how you can express your feelings and get your needs met while strengthening your relationship; how you can provide the kind of support that is most helpful in recovery from depression; and how you can encourage the depressed person to seek treatment. Drawing on their own innovative research, the authors give sensitive advice about how to recognize your needs, and how to find the best help for yourself and your loved one. Whether you are the partner, parent, friend, or child of a depressed person, you'll find this book an invaluable companion in your journey back to health.END</p><b>Xavier Amador, Ph.D.,</b> the coauthor of <i>When Someone You Love Is Depressed</i> and the psychology and health contributor for NBC's weekend <i>Today</i> show, is Director of the Diagnoses and Evaluation Center at Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute.<br><br>Laura Epstein Rosen, Ph.D., is Supervisor of Family Therapy Training at the Special Needs Clinic of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York.</p><h2>Abandoned Parents: The Devil&#39;s Dilemma: The Causes and Consequences of Adult Children Abandoning Their Parents</h2><p>Adult children who abandon their parents are becoming an issue around the globe.

Follow her on Twitter @reallyrosebrock.Dear Reader,<br><br>Like some of you, I&#x2019;m a reader. Like others, I wasn&#x2019;t always. My family came from Germany to the United States when I was in elementary school, and for all kinds of reasons, I struggled. Coming from somewhere different was hard. Learning English&#x2014;learning <i>in</i> English&#x2014;was hard. That slowly changed, thanks mostly to books. Books became my escape, my window to this new American world. I still remember my first book friendships; before I had real friends at my new school, I basked in the company of fictional friends. Since that point, reading books has been one of the things I cherish most.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s another thing you should know about me. Until she passed away, I was fed a steady diet of hopeful anecdotes by my immigrant mother. Hers were often focused on her childhood during World War II in Germany. After losing all their possessions in an Allied bombing, my grandmother and her five children fled their city to Bavaria to start over again while they waited for my grandfather to be released from a camp for prisoners of war. Although my family was on the wrong side of history, it seemed that the lessons served to my mom were ones that resonated, and for that reason, in my childhood home, finding hope was a directive. It was expected that the world&#x2019;s lemons would be made into fresh lemonade. Perhaps that is the reason I&#x2019;m an optimist. A dreamer. A hoper. And whether it&#x2019;s in my genetic makeup to see the glass as half full or it&#x2019;s a product of conditioning, I love stories of resilience and tenacity, and I look for hopeful stories everywhere&#x2014;in books, in movies, and most importantly, in real life. The older I get, the more I understand that finding and holding on to hope can be hard. At times it can feel impossible.<br><br>So what is <i>Hope Nation</i>? Simply, it&#x2019;s a collection of unique and personal experiences shared by some of my favorite writers for teens. Stories of resilience, resistance, hardship, loss, love, tenacity, and acceptance&#x2014;stories that prove that sometimes, hope can be found only on the other side of adversity. I&#x2019;m so grateful to each of these talented writers for sharing their own paths to hope.<br><br>Mr. Rogers of <i>Mr. Rogers&#x2019; Neighborhood</i> once said that during a crisis, it&#x2019;s vital to look for the helpers. The authors featured in <i>Hope Nation</i> are our helpers; the gift of their stories is the reason I am able to share this book with you. The making of it is a hopeful endeavor in every way&#x2014;in lieu of being paid to share their stories, my amazing team of contributors have donated 100 percent of their fees to charities that give meaning to them, organizations and charities working to make our world a better place for you and me. And my publisher is matching each donation.&nbsp; <br><br>To me, <i>Hope Nation</i> is the gift I want to give back to all the young people in my life, especially my daughters, Madeleine and Olivia. It&#x2019;s for the teens closest to me who have been left feeling disempowered and hopeless. We see you. It&#x2019;s for all of you that we say, &#x201c;Hope is a decision.&#x201d; I hope it&#x2019;s a choice you make for yourself.<br><br><i>Dr. Rose Brock</i></p><h2>Konosuba: God&#39;s Blessing on This Wonderful World!, Vol. 6 (light novel): Princess of the Six Flowers (Konosuba (light novel), 6)</h2><p>After being invited to a royal banquet, Kazuma meets the young Princess Iris-the little-sister type he's always dreamed of.

The &#x201c;Alexander the Great of crime fiction&#x201d; (<em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em>) shines in these urban mean streets, setting up a downtown showdown between the psychopathic, thrill-killing &#x201c;Oklahoma Wildman&#x201d; and the dedicated city copy who&#x2019;s determined to take him down. The creator of U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens of TV&#x2019;s <em>Justified</em> fame, Elmore Leonard is the equal of any writer who has ever captivated readers with dark tales of heists, hijacks, double-crosses, and murder&#x2014;John D.

These works from the middle years of his brief career show a skilled hand, with angst muted and his penchant for subtle comedy deftly displayed. Scholars and fans often divide the career of Dazai Osamu (1909-1948) into three periods: early, middle, and late. The early and late periods tend to get all the attention, but in fact Dazai was at his very best in the middle period, which corresponds roughly to the years of the Pacific War.

Longtime Barcelona resident and Spanish food expert Jeff Koehler fills us in on this cherished rice dish, from its origins to just what it takes to make the perfect one (even without an authentic paella pan). Thirty recipes range from the original <em>paella valenciana</em>, studded with chicken and rabbit, to his mother-in-law's Saturday shellfish special, to sumptuous vegetarian variations, to surprising soups and sweet takes. Stunning scenic photographs, shots of the finished dishes, plus a source list of unusual ingredients and special equipment round out this gorgeous homage to one of Spain's national culinary treasures.</p><p>Jeff Koehler has written about food and travel for numerous publications, including Gourmet, Food &amp; Wine, Eating Well, the Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times, and has photographed books on the cuisines of Spain and Seattle's Pike Place Market. After years of travel, he settled in Barcelona, where he has lived for most of the past ten years.Koehler does an excellent job of deconstructing paella, an often intimidating dishes. He clearly explains the different types of rice and the best pans (from which the name paella comes); the largest section of the book focuses on the endless variations of paella, starting with the original Paella Valenciana, made with fresh beans and snails. <i>Paella � la marinera</i> (Fisherman's Paella), one of many seafood versions, includes mussels, monkfish and squid, while <i>Paella de pescado azul</i> is made with bluefish and artichokes. The popular Mixed Poultry and Seafood Paella is included as well as Rosa'sfamous Shellfish Paella. Other delightful versions are Paella with Rabbit and Artichokes and Paella with Pork Ribs and Turnips. Freelance food and travel writer Koehler also presents dishes using the traditionally Spanish <i>cazuela</i> (a wide, shallow terra-cotta casserole) and the <i>caldero</i> (a heavy cast-iron or terra-cotta pot), which produce dishes that are moister and soupier than paella. Two rice pudding recipes make up the dessert section, and Koehler finishes with sources on where to buy rice-cooking equipment and Spanish ingredients, as well as a list of restaurants in Spain that will accommodate every desire. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although this book is considered apocryphal for the Western canon, it is contained in the Ethiopic Bible. It was considered sacred by some important first followers of Christ but it was left out of the Bible and disappeared for centuries until it was rediscovered in 1773 in Ethiopic. This manuscript was first translated into English in the 1820s and into German in the 1830s. According to most scholars, part of it was written in third century BCE and part of it in the first century CE (the part related to the Son of Man). Although the oldest complete copies of 1 Enoch are K-9 or Kebran 9, dated late fourteenth early fifteenth century and Ethiopian Monastic Microfilm Library (EMML 2080) of the fifteenth or fourteenth century, fragments found in Qumram in the 1950s are more than 2000 years old. Other old important manuscripts are Abbadianus 55 (possibly fifteenth century) and British Museum Orient 485 (first half of the sixteenth century).</p><p>The 2nd Book of Enoch, the Slavonic Enoch, or 2 Enoch, is another apocryphal book, found complete only in Old Slavonic manuscripts, and it was once present in the Old Slavonic Bible. It&#x2019;s usually dated to the first century CE although Matthew Black in The Oxford Guide to People &amp; Places of the Bible state that there is no manuscript &#x201c;earlier than the fourteenth century BE&#x201d;.</p><p>The 3rd Book of Enoch, the Hebrew Enoch, or 3 Enoch, is a Rabbinic text originally written in Hebrew usually dated to the fifth century CE. Some experts believe it was written by Rabbi Ishmael (second century CE), familiar with both 1 Enoch and 2 Enoch.</p><p>The Book of Giants contains a narrative that involves the antediluvian giant offspring originally known from both the Genesis and the Book of Enoch. The Book of Giants resembles particularly 1 Enoch:&nbsp;The First Book of Enoch.</p></p><p></p><h2>Thunder Underground</h2><p>In this collection of poems, noted children&#x2019;s poet Jane Yolen takes readers on an expedition underground, exploring everything from animal burrows and human creations, like subways, near the surface&#x2014;to ancient cities and fossils, lower down&#x2014;to caves, magma, and Earth&#x2019;s tectonic plates, deeper still below our feet.

And now there's a new reason to cheer: Nina Crews has added her own remarkable, jazzy style of illustration to a collection of forty-one favorite verses. Whether it's Jack jumping over a candlestick (atop a cupcake), Georgie Porgie kissing the girls (at the playground), or a fine lady riding a white horse (on the carousel), this exuberant treasury is sure to be read and enjoyed over and over again.</p></p><p><p>Nina Crews drew inspiration from her own neighborhood in creating the artwork for both this book and its celebrated companion, <em>The Neighborhood Mother Goose</em>.

She lives with her family in Brooklyn, New York.</p>*Starred Review* PreS. Nina Crews' clear, beautiful color photographs and computer manipulations bring children close-up to people like them. In this modern Mother Goose, she uses computer tools to combine photos of joyful kids in her Brooklyn neighborhood with all kinds of scenarios, realistic and wild. In "Hey diddle diddle!" a brooding cat holding a violin watches a boy running on the sidewalk, while a silver spoon looms over a wooden fence and a cow walks in the air above a full moon. In contrast, the illustration for "Pat-a-Cake" is homey and real: two girls clap hands in a front of a bakery window. The child's sense of being small in a world of giants is beautifully captured in the double-page spread of tiny kids jumping in a giant shoe. Realism, of course, has never been part of the Mother Goose nonsense drama, but preschoolers will enjoy seeing kids like themselves in pictures that make the familiar rhymes part of imaginative fun on the city sidewalk, where girls and boys come out to ride their scooters and bikes, play ball, and dream. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It&nbsp; takes care of the royal family and has a special affinity for the youngest princess, Celie, having helped her thwart an attempted coup in Tuesdays at the Castle (Bloomsbury, 2011). On her way to her lessons one Wednesday, Celie is led up a spiral staircase to a roofless tower containing a large egg. The Castle clearly wants it kept secret, so only Celie is present when it hatches to reveal a mythical griffin. Despite repeated attempts to tell her parents about it, the Castle prevents her from revealing its existence to all but her oldest brother, Bran; the Royal Wizard; and Pogue Parry, a family friend. With their help, Celie cares for the griffin, dubbed Rufus, and explores the Castle's history and connection to the animals. Complicating their search is the Castle's recent spate of potentially dangerous changes and the arrival of a mysterious wizard. There is plenty to charm readers in this second book in the series. The excitement of raising (and riding!) a griffin will entice readers, and Celie continues to be a plucky, capable heroine. The Castle is a character in its own right, and readers will be fascinated to learn more about its history, but they will have to wait until the next book for answers to the many mysteries raised by the revelation of its origins.&#x2013;Amanda Raklovits, Champaign Public Library, IL&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

It was a good star. Draw me a sun, said the star. And the artist drew a sun.&nbsp;</i>And on the artist draws, bringing the world to life picture by beautiful picture until he is spirited across the night sky by a star that shines on all he has made. In <i>Draw Me a Star</i>, Eric Carle celebrates the imagination in all of us with a beguiling story about a young artist who creates a world of light and possibility. <br><br>"A remarkable, quintessentially simple book encompassing Creation, creativity, and the cycle of life within the eternal." &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, pointer review "This book will appeal to readers of all ages. An inspired book in every sense of the word." &#x2014;<i>School Library Journal "</i>A fable about the passage through life and its fullness of possibilities, children will like the cumulative effects of the tale, the creation of the world through paints, and Carle's collages flaring with rainbow hues." &#x2014;<i>The Bulletin of the Center for Children?s Books</i></p><p>Eric Carle is acclaimed and beloved as the creator of brilliantly illustrated and innovatively designed picture books for very young children. His best-known work,&nbsp;<b>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</b>, has eaten its way into the hearts of literally millions of children all over the world and has been translated into more than 25 languages and sold over twelve million copies. Since the&nbsp;<b>Caterpillar</b>&nbsp;was published in 1969, Eric Carle has illustrated more than sixty books, many best sellers, most of which he also wrote.During his youth, this gifted authorartist explains in his newest book's afterword, his German grandmother would often draw him a star while chanting a nonsense rhyme. Taking that symbol as his foundation, Carle here creates a world pulsating with life and color-a world that bursts forth from a good star sketched by a young artist. This kaleidoseopic pentagram requests a sun from the artist's pen; the sun asks for a tree, and so on until a man and woman are living happily among Carle's characteristic collages-flora and fauna of all shapes, sizes and vivid hues. Meanwhile the artist, now a bearded old man, continues to draw and create. This unusual, practically plotless work seems to embody a personal scenario close to the artist's heart. His unadorned language, pulsing with a hypnotic rhythm, adroitly complements the familiar naive artwork. Though some may be disturbed by similarities between Carle's evolving world and the biblical creation story (the unclothed male and female figures, for example), this tale of imagination and creativity pays homage to the artist within all of us-and may well fire youngsters' imaginations.

It takes God very seriously but helps the reader to 'lighten-up!' It reminds me of the quote, 'Laughter is another way of crossing ourselves!' <p>From the picture of Luther on the cover (is this his confirmation photo?) to the final pages of 'tongue in check' humor, these pages are a great mix of what life is all about &#x2014; hurts and hoorays, Good Fridays and Easters, life and death, praying and playing! The only addition I would have made is to have each page contain a 'caution flag' that would state either, 'I'm serious' or 'I'm kidding!' to assist the reader to know how to react! I know many Lutherans who will spend an inordinate amount of time thinking whether or not they should laugh, cry, pray, or scratch their heads...and certainly look around to see if anyone else is looking before they respond accordingly! </p><p>I commend the editors and Augsburg for taking the Lord seriously enough to allow the Lord's followers to 'lighten-up' in the Lord of Laughter and Life!

What if you could have been a witness to the events of the last days of Jesus&#x2019; life&#x2014;walking with him as he entered Jerusalem, observing his crucifixion, and embracing him on Easter?</b><br><br><i>Walk in Her Sandals</i>, edited by popular Catholic author and speaker Kelly M. Wahlquist, takes you deeper into your relationship with Jesus by helping you relate to him in a profoundly intimate way. Looking at six universal gifts of women through the eyes of women in the gospels, the book guides you on a prayerful and creative journey through the days of Holy Week, Easter, and Pentecost.<br><br> As you imagine the experience of the women who met Jesus, you will discover how each of them expressed one of six, distinctive, feminine gifts identified in the writings of St. John Paul II. Through the eyes of an imagined woman who watched Jesus&#x2019; entry into Jerusalem, you will understand how she conveyed the gift of receptivity. Through the hands of Veronica, who reached out to wipe the face of Jesus, you will discover how sensitivity is present and can grow in your own life. These gifts, along with generosity, prayer, maternity, and the Holy Spirit, come to life through the vivid portrayal of women who walked with Jesus. Their imagined stories are complemented by the real accounts of contemporary women who share their own stories of receiving and cultivating these gifts.<br><br><i>Walk in Her Sandals</i> is a collaborative effort, edited by Wahlquist with contributions from twelve leading Catholic women writers, all of whom are associated with the organization she founded&#x2014;WINE: Women In the New Evangelization. The contributors will help you break open the scripture, reflect upon it and apply it to your own life, and share those insights in a small-group setting through the use of questions and challenges. Each chapter unfolds in eight movements: <ul><li><b>A Moment to Ponder</b>: Wahlquist sets the stage for the theme of that chapter.</li><li><b>Entering the Scripture:</b> Sarah Christmyer, codeveloper of The Great Adventure Catholic Bible Study, reveals the riches of the scripture that corresponds with the day, both in the biblical narrative and in the liturgical year.</li><li><b>Walk in Her Sandals</b>: Stephanie Landsem, author of the biblical fiction series The Living Water, draws you into the story and allows you to experience what it may have been like for women who lived and walked with Jesus.</li><li><b>Unwrapping the Gift</b>: Catholic author, speaker, and faith-formation leader Pat Gohn shows how each woman demonstrates a particular feminine gift and invites you to nurture that gift in yourself and understand anew the beauty of your dignity and vocation.</li><li><b>Reflect on the Meaning</b>: Writers including <i>CatholicMom.com</i> founder Lisa M. Hendey and popular media personality Teresa Tomeo offer insight, encouragement, and inspiration for your own journey through their personal stories.</li><li><b>Lectio and Meditatio</b>: A prayerful reading of the scripture and a guided meditation to draw you more deeply into an intimate relationship with Jesus.</li><li><b>Questions for Group Discussion</b>: Carol Younger, senior fellow at the St. Paul Center for Biblical Theology, offers a helpful tool to share your experience with other women.</li><li><b>Walking in the New Evangelization</b>: Wahlquist offers two ways to contribute to the New Evangelization&#x2014;first by growing in your contemplative spiritual life and then by giving you practical suggestions to enhance your active spiritual life.</li></ul><i>Walk in Her Sandals</i> will allow you to enter more fully into life in Christ by praying over his passion, death, and resurrection. It will help you experience a conversion of heart and recognize your own giftedness.</p><p><p><b>Kelly M.

Experience how those moments forever changed their lives, and moment by intimate moment, you, too, will be changed." --<b>Sonja Corbitt</b>, Catholic speaker, radio host, and author of <i>Unleashed</i><br><br> "Kelly Wahlquist's stunning team effort, <i>Walk in Her Sandals</i>, dramatically raises the bar for women's resources with its innovative approach to exploring feminine gifts as pathways to Christ." --<b>Lisa Mladinich</b>, Catholic author and creator of <i>Amazing Catechists</i><br><br> "In <i>Walk in Her Sandals</i> you will hear a symphony of wisdom, insight, and practical application. What this team of women has accomplished is remarkable. They have opened up a world of opportunity for other women to enjoy their relationship with God and at the same time discover aspects of their being in a new and profound way." --<b>Jeff Cavins</b>, Coauthor of <i>The Great Adventure Catholic Bible Study Program</i><br><br> "<i>Walk in Her Sandals</i> teaches readers to use imaginative prayer by bringing to life the women who accompanied Christ through his passion, death, and resurrection. It seeks to help contemporary women discover their own call to be missionary disciples in the service of the New Evangelization. Many will benefit from reading this book." --<b>Most Rev. Andrew Cozzens</b>, Auxiliary Bishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis<br><br> "This book truly makes the scriptural account of Christ's passion come alive! Readers will find themselves entering into the story in a whole new way and experiencing the unique gifts and central role of women.

This collection of six laugh-out-loud stories is sure to tickle the funny bone of fans and new readers alike. <i>Kirkus </i>writes about the series, "These twins make learning to read double the fun."</p><p>Grace Lin is the Newbery Honor and bestselling author and illustrator of <i>Starry River of the Sky</i>, <i>Where the Mountain Meets the Moon</i>, <i>The Year of the Dog</i>, <i>The Year of the Rat</i>, <i>Dumpling Days</i>, and <i>Ling &amp; Ting</i>. Grace is a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design and lives in Massachusetts.PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;Those irrepressible twins are back with more sweetly goofy antics in a third installment of the easy reader series. Six short chapters deliver on the title's promise; each episode unfolds with pitch-perfect comedic timing, ending with a chuckle-worthy (and decidedly silly) punch line. From forays into gardening (Will cupcakes grow if planted like seeds?) to musing about how high they can swing (Higher than a tree that goes into outer space!), the girls' lives are grounded in realistic childhood experiences, embellished with their creative imaginings. Lin helps emergent readers tell the difference through clever visual cues; the pretend and "what if" scenarios are distinguished by squiggly frames. As in the first two books, the gouache illustrations pop with vibrant color and texture. Lin's images help support the text, while extending the humor with subtle details in facial expressions and body language. Though each chapter can be enjoyed on its own, the various threads come together in the last chapter when the sisters co-create their own story&#x2014;a book within the book. Fans of Ling and Ting will be delighted to see a few nods to previous adventures, while new readers will want to get to know these funny sisters better. A winning addition to a delightfully fun series. &#x2014;Kiera Parrott, School Library Journal</p><h2>Sports Illustrated Hockey&#39;s Greatest</h2><p>There is no greater authority on all things sports than <i>Sports Illustrated</i> magazine.

Is it any wonder that traditional Law of Attraction techniques which focus on &#x201c;doing&#x201d; and &#x201c;attracting&#x201d; something from out there to fill a perceived lack in our lives do not create lasting results?<br><br>But if all our abundance is already right here for our taking, why is it that our bank balance and physical experiences do not always reflect this truth? Is there something we have to do in order to welcome this abundance into our lives? <br><br><b>Dollars Flow To Me Easily</b> takes an alternative approach to answering these questions. Instead of guiding the reader through a series of exercises to &#x201c;feel as if&#x201d; they are already rich, Richard draws on the power of words and our highest intentions to dissolve negative feelings and misconceptions that block us from manifesting greater financial abundance in our lives. <br><br>When these blocks are gently dissolved and let go of through absorbing the words in this book, what results are natural physical manifestations of abundance in our everyday experience. <br><br>As Richard puts it, this technique is so counter-intuitive precisely because it flies in the face of everything we have been taught. We have been taught to tackle our financial issues head-on and to worry about them constantly in order to come up with solutions. But despite this, all our worrying and mental activity has still not resulted in everlasting peace-of-mind and a permanent resolution of the financial issues in our lives. <br><br>Perhaps the real solution that we need is to simply correct our thinking on the inside, and to realize that there has been no issue and no lack in the first place. When we tend to our inner states and make it our priority... when we finally give up the need to do anything to make things happen... that is when the Universe can deliver our highest good to us.<br><br><b>Dollars Flow To Me Easily</b> takes you through the experiential journey of dropping all your worries, fears and blocks around manifesting money as you read. What remains at the end is the real you &#x2014; a state in which dollars flow to you easily and a recognition of this truth that has always been a part of your being.</p><p></p><h2>Bear on the Loose!: A Branches Book (Hilde Cracks the Case #2) (2)</h2><p><b>There's a bear on the loose in Selinsgrove!

His grandfather, father, and older brother had created their own sports legends in a declining city; he was the last, best hope for a career beyond the shuttered mills and factories. Herren was heavily recruited by major universities, chosen as a McDonald's All-American, featured in a <i>Sports Illustrated</i> cover story, and at just seventeen years old became the central figure in <i>Fall River Dreams,</i> an acclaimed book about the 1994 Durfee team's quest for the state championship. </p><p> Leaving Fall River for college, Herren starred on Jerry Tarkanian's Fresno State Bulldogs team of talented misfits, which included future NBA players as well as future convicted felons. His gritty, tattooed, hip-hop persona drew the ire of rival fans and more national attention: <i>Rolling Stone</i> profiled him, <i>60 Minutes</i> interviewed him, and the Denver Nuggets drafted him. When the Boston Celtics acquired his contract, he lived the dream of every Massachusetts kid&#x2015;but off the court Herren was secretly crumbling, as his alcohol and drug use escalated and his life spiraled out of control.</p><p> Twenty years later, Chris Herren was married to his high-school sweetheart, the father of three young children, and a heroin junkie. His basketball career was over, consumed by addictions; he had no job, no skills, and was a sadly familiar figure to those in Fall River who remembered him as a boy, now prowling the streets he once ruled, looking for a fix. One day, for a time he cannot remember, he would die. </p><p> In his own words, Chris Herren tells how he nearly lost everything and everyone he loved, and how he found a way back to life. Powerful, honest, and dramatic, <i>Basketball Junkie </i>is a remarkable memoir, harrowing in its descent, and heartening in its return.</p></p><p><p>CHRIS HERREN is a former NBA basketball player for the Denver Nuggets and the Boston Celtics. His company, Hoop Dreams with Chris Herren, Inc., provides basketball training for young players as well as educational talks. He lives in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. </p><p>Chris Herren is the founder of Hoop Dreams with Chris Herren, a basketball player development company; the author of <i>Basketball Junkie</i>; and a public speaker with the American Program Bureau. </p><p>BILL REYNOLDS is a sports columnist for <i>The</i> <i>Providence Journal </i>and the author of several previous books, including <i>Fall River Dreams </i>and (with Rick Pitino) the #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>Success Is a Choice. </i>He lives in Providence, Rhode Island.</p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br>&nbsp;<br>I was dead for thirty seconds.<br>That&#x2019;s what the cop in Fall River told me.<br>He said that two EMTs had brought me back to life.<br>&#x201c;Just shut the fuck up,&#x201d; he said when I started to say something. &#x201c;You were almost dead.&#x201d;<br>I was only a few blocks from where I had grown up, only a few blocks from B.M.C. Durfee High School, where there was a banner on the wall saying I was the highest scorer in Durfee history. I had gone off the street near the cemetery where Lizzie Borden was buried, Oak Grove. Maybe the worst thing was that I had just driven through Fall River for a couple of miles in a blackout, a ride I don&#x2019;t remember to this day. When the EMTs found me there was a needle in my arm and a packet of heroin in the front seat.<br>It was only about two in the afternoon, but I had been going at it heavy since early in the morning. I had put my seven-year-old daughter, Samantha, in the car like I did every morning after my wife, Heather, went to work. We drove through the nice suburban neighborhood in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, where we lived, and went to East Main Road, where the liquor store was. I bought a pint of Popov vodka, poured it into an empty water bottle, and started to drink. Then we went back home to wait for the bus that took Sammy to school.<br>By the time she was on the bus I had finished the pint, and I went back to the package store to get another one. Now I needed some money, so I drove to nearby Middletown, virtually on the Newport line, where Heather was working in a hotel. She had told me that morning that she would leave some money in the car for me. It was $40 under the mat in the front seat, and I started off to Fall River, about twenty minutes from my house, to meet one of my drug dealers. I gave him the $40, and he gave me five bags of heroin. I didn&#x2019;t take heroin at night. I&#x2019;d shoot up at four thirty in the afternoon, just before Heather got home, so sometimes in the morning I&#x2019;d be starting to get sick and needed more.<br>This was my daily routine, had been for about eight months. Put Sammy on the bus, go to Fall River, do some dope, and get back in time for when Sammy and my nine-year-old son, Chris, came home on the bus. That was my life, the only way I could function.<br>Sometimes I couldn&#x2019;t wait to put Sammy on the bus to go get my dope, because I was getting too sick, so I would put her in the backseat and speed to go meet a dealer in Fall River. I would make the buy and shoot up in the car while I was driving, Samantha still in the backseat.<br>How could I have done this?<br>People ask me that all the time. How could you shoot up with your daughter in the backseat? They can&#x2019;t believe it. Not surprising. I can&#x2019;t believe it either.<br>But that&#x2019;s what I did.<br>People think that when you&#x2019;re doing drugs you&#x2019;re high all the time, out partying. They think you&#x2019;re having fun. That&#x2019;s not it at all. You&#x2019;re not having fun. You&#x2019;re in hell. Without the dope I would be &#x201c;dope sick,&#x201d; so sick that I couldn&#x2019;t do anything, couldn&#x2019;t even get up. I&#x2019;d be in a fetal position. You have the sweats one minute, and you&#x2019;re freezing cold the next. It&#x2019;s like having the flu with restless legs, because you can&#x2019;t control them. They&#x2019;re kickin&#x2019; all over the place. You also can&#x2019;t sleep more than fifteen minutes at a time. You wake up in the morning and there&#x2019;s no blanket, no sheets, the mattress is sideways. And when it gets bad, you want to ram your head into the headboard.<br>With the dope I could function, if you want to call it that. I could drive a car. I could mow the lawn. I could be something of a husband, something of a father. When I pictured a heroin addict before I became one, I saw someone emaciated, someone nodding off. That wasn&#x2019;t it with me, not in the beginning, anyway. I didn&#x2019;t do it to get high. I did it to function. By the time I got to heroin I was so far gone on OxyContin that the dope became medicine, something that made me feel good enough to be able to get through a day.<br>But there had been three times in the four months leading up to the day I essentially died when I overdosed, became that guy nodding off, the stereotype of a junkie. Because I was getting worse. Once, I had left Fall River at about eleven thirty in the morning and was driving on South Main Street into neighboring Tiverton on my way home, which was maybe ten minutes away, and I couldn&#x2019;t keep my eyes open. I nodded off, woke up by the side of the road about two and half hours later with one of my feet out the door. Another time I passed out in a house in Fall River with four other people there, and they were so scared that I was going to die they called 911. But I came out of it, and was walking out the door while the police were coming up the sidewalk.<br>My body was breaking down, but I didn&#x2019;t stop.<br>That&#x2019;s the fucked-up world you&#x2019;re in. Someone will OD on something they got from a particular dealer, and everyone else goes to that dealer because he&#x2019;s obviously got some great stuff.<br>So by the time I was in Fall River that June day, the heroin on top of the vodka must have put me under, because the next thing I remember was the cop talking to me on the way to Charlton Hospital, the same hospital where my mother had died three years earlier. And all I could think of was that my kids were going to see this on the news, and that I was going to go to jail, and that I was in trouble again. That this was going to be one more horror show, complete with more headlines and more TV spots.<br>A similar thing had happened four years earlier. I had passed out in a Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts drive-through window at eight in the morning virtually around the corner from my house. I had been arrested, it had been all over the media, and it had ended my basketball career. I had come home from a CBA team in South Dakota, trying to get back to the NBA after several years of playing overseas, trying for one last shot, trying to salvage my career.<br>But this was worse.<br>I had no money.<br>Basketball was over.<br>I had no job.<br>My two kids were older now, nine and seven, old enough to know what was on the news. Old enough for their friends to know what was on the news.<br>Heather was eight months pregnant.<br>When I got to the hospital I was more drunk than high. The nurses were staring at me. They all knew who I was, and I wasn&#x2019;t a pretty sight. I didn&#x2019;t have any insurance, so the hospital wasn&#x2019;t going to admit me. I was in the emergency room, and I was thinking of ways to kill myself, because I had no hope. That was gone, had been gone for a while. I couldn&#x2019;t stop sweating because all the opiates were sucked out of my body after a shot of Narcan, which immediately brings on withdrawal.<br>Eventually, a nurse came over to me, a Mrs. Reid. She said she had known my mother, and that her husband had been a big Durfee fan, had watched the games with Mr. Karam&#x2019;s brother Bob (known as &#x201c;Boo Boo&#x201d;).<br>&#x201c;Where are you going?&#x201d; she asked me.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Come sit with me.&#x201d;<br>I broke down, and then my older brother, Michael, whom I&#x2019;d called, walked in. He was crying, too.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to figure this out,&#x201d; Mrs. Reid said to me.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>They got me into the hospital.<br>The worst thing was calling Heather, and the surprising thing was that she wasn&#x2019;t angry. Or maybe it wasn&#x2019;t that surprising. We were way beyond anger by this point. We had been married for nine years, but I had known her since the sixth grade, when I met her at a playground in Somerset, just across the river from Fall River. She was by far the cutest girl I had ever seen, and from the start I was in love with her, even though I put gum in her hair that day. That should have been the first red flag for her.<br>We were always close, and all through high school we would go out for a while, then we&#x2019;d break up, but we&#x2019;d always get back together. We were never really in a boyfriend-girlfriend situation, because I was in no way ready for that back then. But we were in each other&#x2019;s lives. She was Heather Gray then, and came from a much more stable family situation than I did, and she watched the chaos of my life from the sidelines. She knew my world was spinning. But with her I lived a different life. She never cared about my basketball, and I liked that. With her I wasn&#x2019;t a basketball player. We went to proms together. She was a homecoming queen, a cheerleader, a star. We took different roads many, many times as kids. But somehow, some way, we always reconnected.<br>We got married in Fall River the summer before my senior year at Fresno State. Heather was pregnant, and there was no way in the world I wasn&#x2019;t going to marry her. Our son, Christopher, was born the following March.<br>By that afternoon in 2008, though, there had been so much heartbreak, so much horror, so much hell. There had been days living in the dark because the electricity had been turned off and we didn&#x2019;t have the money to turn it back on. There had been times when we had run out of heating oil and I would take a red gasoline can to the nearby Mobil station, fill it with diesel fuel for ten bucks, and trick the oil burner into starting again. There had been many times when Heather had thrown me out, telling me it was really over this time, that she couldn&#x2019;t live this way anymore, and I would end up in some fleabag motel in nearby Newport for a few days. Then the money would run out and I would sleep in my car, until finally she would feel sorry for me and take me back and then it would start all over again, all the lies and betrayals, the false promises and the squandered chances. This is how we lived. We were always trying to hide the ugly reality from the kids, even when they were sitting in the dark and the TV didn&#x2019;t work and it was cold.<br>I would steal money from Heather, a...</p><h2>I Like Giving: The Transforming Power of a Generous Life</h2><p><b>Rich with inspiring stories and practical suggestions,&nbsp;<i>I Like Giving</i>&nbsp;will help you create a lifestyle of generosity.</b><br>&nbsp;<br> Choosing to live a generous life can transform you and the world around you.

Away from her family, living in an apartment on<br>the lower end of town, a single mom to a three-year-old and eight months pregnant, she was relying on welfare and<br>food stamps to get by. While other families were preparing for their Thanksgiving feasts, Tracy would do the best she<br>could with canned food.<br><br>Standing in her apartment and looking at the sparse collection of cans on her shelf, Tracy heard a knock at the<br>door. <i>What in the world? she thought. Who would be coming to her door on Thanksgiving Day? Weren&#x2019;t people at home<br>with their families, eating turkey and watching football?<br><br></i>She opened her door and simply couldn&#x2019;t believe her eyes. Standing there was a man from a local restaurant with<br>a delivery for Tracy: a full Thanksgiving dinner, complete with all the trimmings. He said it was from an anonymous<br>donor, and before Tracy could ask any questions, he handed it over and left. Tracy was so overwhelmed that she spent the rest of the day crying.<br><br>Surprised and amazed, Tracy decided she needed to know whom to thank for this extravagant and timely gift. However, she couldn&#x2019;t fi gure it out. She called her parents, but it wasn&#x2019;t them. She asked her friends, but no one knew. Tracy couldn&#x2019;t believe that someone outside her circle of friends and family had noticed her situation and done something about it without drawing any attention to himself.<br><br>Years went by, and Tracy still had no idea whom the mysterious Thanksgiving dinner had come from. In time she moved out of that apartment and began working as a nurse at a local hospital.<br><br>And then it happened. Seven years after that special Thanksgiving meal, a woman named Margot was admitted into Tracy&#x2019;s care. Margot had multiple sclerosis, and her condition was becoming critical. Tracy remembered Margot from her time on welfare. She had lived in the same apartment building as Tracy. It was clear that Margot didn&#x2019;t have much longer to live.<br><br>Three days before her death, Margot took Tracy&#x2019;s hand in hers and, in a frail voice, whispered two words: &#x201c;Happy<br>Thanksgiving.&#x201d;<br><br>In that moment Tracy knew who had given her that Thanksgiving dinner. She would never have guessed that Margot&#x2014;the unassuming neighbor with multiple sclerosis&#x2014;was behind that generous gift. Tracy still gets tears in her eyes when she tells the story today.<br><br>I&#x2019;d call that story &#x201c;I Like My Neighbor.&#x201d; Margot saw Tracy&#x2019;s situation that Thanksgiving Day and did something extraordinary&#x2014;she gave her the perfect gift without anyone asking her to and without asking for anything in return.<br>That one gift had a massive impact on Tracy&#x2019;s life. Moved by the anonymous donor&#x2019;s generosity, Tracy purposed in her heart to do generous things for other people too. The very day she got off assistance, she took a basket of gifts down to the welfare offi ce for anyone to take. The welfare offi cer was stunned. Can you imagine the look on his face? Who does something like that?<br><br>And that was just the beginning. Since then, Tracy and her husband have become foster parents and adopted a son. She regularly looks for opportunities to give. The last time I heard from her, she was getting ready to volunteer her Saturday afternoon at the local Humane Society. One of her latest ideas is to leave fi ve-dollar Starbucks gift cards<br>with little notes for her coworkers to fi nd, just to make their day better. This year Tracy and her family made a New<br>Year&#x2019;s resolution to fi nd one hundred opportunities to give to other people. How inspiring is that?<br><br>What I appreciate most about Tracy is that she doesn&#x2019;t do her giving to be noticed by others. Since that Thanksgiving Day in 1993, she has discovered the joy that comes from giving. Now she&#x2019;s hooked. She doesn&#x2019;t give to make herself look good&#x2014;she gives because she likes giving. It makes her feel more alive. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s how life should be,&#x201d; she says.<br><br>There is something incredible about giving when it&#x2019;s our idea. Opening our eyes and ears to the people around us and asking &#x201c;How can we give?&#x201d; is a profoundly life-giving and satisfying way to live. One of Jesus&#x2019;s ideas was that it is more blessed to give than to receive. I have found that to be true. The generous life is the only life worth living.<br>Just imagine&#x2014;what if every single person on the planet woke up and, like Tracy, looked for ways to give? What sort of world could we create through the simple, powerful decision to live generously? Whoever you are, no matter how much or how little you have to share, making the decision to give regularly to others&#x2014;daily, weekly, or monthly&#x2014;will enrich your life and change the lives of the people around you.<br><br>When we choose to give, we change, and the people around us change. When we move from awareness to action, miracles happen. When we allow giving to be our idea, a world of possibilities opens up before us, and we discover new levels of joy. If you, like Tracy, get hooked on giving, you&#x2019;ll fi nd yourself asking, &#x201c;How generous can I be?&#x201d; When that happens, you&#x2019;ll realize that, not only are you loving life more than ever, but you&#x2019;re also a part of creating a more generous world&#x2014;a world that is better for all of us. If you haven&#x2019;t ever experienced the joy of giving, or it&#x2019;s been a long time, this book will show you where to start. We will walk with you as you take your fi rst steps, and we&#x2019;ll stick with you as you grow in the art of generosity.<br><br>Or if you&#x2019;re nodding your head right now, saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve known this for years,&#x201d; then we&#x2019;re here to encourage you to keep growing and to empower you to spread the joy. We never arrive. I&#x2019;ve been discovering the joy of generous living for many years, and I still feel as if I&#x2019;m just getting started!<br><br>The best things in life are like that&#x2014;they grow and never end.</p><h2>The Digital Transformation Playbook: Rethink Your Business for the Digital Age (Columbia Business School Publishing)</h2><p>Rethink your business for the digital age.<br><br>Every business begun before the Internet now faces the same challenge: How to transform to compete in a digital economy?<br><br>Globally recognized digital expert David L.

I don&#x2019;t know if it&#x2019;s comin&#x2019; from outside or from Mama, who&#x2019;s burning up angry at me. She ain&#x2019;t said nothin&#x2019; to me since we left the principal&#x2019;s office &#x2019;bout a hour ago. But she got her foot pressed on the gas like we in a race, zoomin&#x2019; past everyone on the expressway. <br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do this no more, Cole.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Do what?&#x201d; I say. <br> But I know. I only seen her this angry once before, and this is worse.&nbsp; <br> &#x201c;Where we going?&#x201d; I ask. <br> She don&#x2019;t answer. By the time we hit the interstate outta Detroit, I can see she crying. I hate when she do that. It makes me feel bad inside, &#x2019;cause I&#x2019;m always the one who makes her feel that way. <br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Mama.&#x201d; <br> She wipes her eyes on her sleeve. <br> &#x201c;Me too, baby. Me too,&#x201d; she says, all sad. <br> I see the city slowly disappearing, turning into suburbs. I know she gotta work early in the morning, so we can&#x2019;t be driving that far. I ask her again. <br> &#x201c;Where we going?&#x201d; <br> Cars is falling behind us &#x2019;cause she speedin&#x2019; up. <br> &#x201c;Mama&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> She chokes it out: &#x201c;Philadelphia.&#x201d; <br> I laugh, then see she ain&#x2019;t joking. <br> <i>&#x201c;What?!&#x201d;</i> I stare at her hard. <br> Her hands is shaking, so she grab the steering wheel tighter. <br> <i>&#x201c;Philly?&#x201d;</i> I say, my head spinning. &#x201c;What for?&#x201d; <br> She pulls on her hair and grunts. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t be your mama right now. You need a man in your life.&#x201d; <br> I try to let that sink in, but my ears is on fire. &#x201c;What you talking about? Who&#x2019;s in Philly?&#x201d; <br> She sighs. <br> &#x201c;Your daddy.&#x201d;<br> My daddy. <br> Who I never met. <br> Who Mama never talks about. <br> Once I asked if she had a picture of him, and she said she burned &#x2019;em all. When I kept on her, all she said was he didn&#x2019;t care about us and now he gone and good riddance. <br> She never said nothing more. <br> Now I find out we gonna go see him? <br> <i>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; </i><br> She just holds up her hand like she can&#x2019;t even go there, like the idea that she gonna take me to him is the last thing she&#x2019;d ever do.<br> But she doing it. And then it hits me: &#x201c;You wanna get rid of me.&#x201d; <br> That gets her. I can see her holding that steering wheel so tight her knuckles is turning white. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do this no more,&#x201d; she says to no one. &#x201c;After twelve years, I got nothing left.&#x201d; <br> <i>That&#x2019;s crazy talk.</i> She can&#x2019;t leave me. &#x201c;But you my mama! You supposed to watch out for me!&#x201d; <br> She bites her lip, her eyes locked on some faraway place. &#x201c;I used to think your daddy was a bad father . . . that he didn&#x2019;t know how to take care of us. But now I&#x2019;m thinking there&#x2019;s something wrong with me &#x2019;cause I don&#x2019;t know why you are the way you are,&#x201d; 4 she say. &#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;s the only one left who can turn you around.&#x201d; <br> She startin&#x2019; to scare me now, talkin&#x2019; like that. &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t so bad, Mama. I can do better.&#x201d; <br> She nod, fightin&#x2019; for words. &#x201c;I know you can, baby. You just need someone that can show you the way. But that ain&#x2019;t me no more, Cole.&#x201d; <br> I can&#x2019;t believe what I&#x2019;m hearin&#x2019;. &#x201c;So you gonna leave me with some dude who never cared about us? Some guy who treated you so bad, you never talk about him?&#x201d; <br> She stares ahead, her eyes wet. She ain&#x2019;t disagreeing. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s different is all. But maybe different is what you need.&#x201d; <br> And with that, she just shuts down. <br> I seen that look before. It means she made up her mind. I think about grabbing that steering wheel and turning the car around, but she like a rock and, deep down, I know I gone too far this time.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>TWO</b><br> &nbsp;<br> I stare out the window. Even though it&#x2019;s getting dark out, I can see we in the middle a nowhere. No lights from no city. <br> Nothing. It looks just like I feel, all empty inside. <br> I don&#x2019;t know why I stopped going to school. I guess I didn&#x2019;t wanna waste no more time with teachers and homework and all a that, &#x2019;cause what difference do it make in the end? I&#x2019;ll never do nothing great in my life. Do they really think I&#x2019;m gonna be like Obama? Not a chance. I just feel sorry for Mama for thinking that I could be somebody.<br> She just found out yesterday that I missed the last four weeks of school. That I been hiding them letters and erasing the messages from the vice principal, even duckin&#x2019; the truancy officer when he comes by. With her working so much, that wasn&#x2019;t so hard to do &#x2019;cause I done it before and knew all the tricks. But it was the first time I got caught, on account of the truancy officer finding me tagging the back of the school cafeteria while school was going on. Stupid. <br> She really lost it when she found out they was gonna suspend me for the rest of the year. If I wasn&#x2019;t twelve, they woulda kicked me out for good, but now they talking about holding me back. <br> I ain&#x2019;t never seen her so sad before, like she thought it was all her fault. It made me feel like dirt seeing her sittin&#x2019; on the kitchen floor crying, but I knew there was nothin&#x2019; I could do to help her, &#x2019;cept to let her get it all out. That&#x2019;s how we deal. <br> Today, Mama had to skip work to come in to talk to the principal. He went on and on about how I was in danger&#x2014;rattling off a buncha numbers like how four outta every ten black boys drop outta school, and seven outta ten can&#x2019;t get no job and &#x2019;cause a that, six of us will end up in prison. I could see Mama sinking into herself, like he was saying it was all her fault for not being a good mama. <br> In the old days, seemed she had the energy to read to me and stuff, and we made drawings together or laid under the covers, talking about where we would go if we could live anywhere else but Detroit. . . . <br> But that was when I was a kid. Them days is gone. Kids can be happy &#x2019;cause they don&#x2019;t know better, but when you get older, well, you just know it&#x2019;s all a big lie. Last three years, Mama&#x2019;s been so moody, like a cloud passed in front of her face. Sometime she look at me and it&#x2019;s like she don&#x2019;t see me. I been on my own a lot &#x2019;cause a that and &#x2019;cause she gotta work so much. I been roaming the streets, skippin&#x2019; school and hanging with my friends, staying out late, which she don&#x2019;t like.

What a relief. No longer does each ache and pain trigger a fear in me of &#34;Oh God, is that &#39;it&#39; coming back again?&#34; Cancer does that to you. It&#39;s an inner nagging, a constant reminder that there could be something bigger than yourself lurking out there in the shadows, sitting back, like a predator, deciding when and if it cares to strike again. Now, finally, I can release that fear. The predator has been locked up, in prison, hopefully never to be let out again. Along the way in this war I have been fighting have come the blessings. I am truly loved by those who mean the most to me. They showed me this over and over during this time. Through it all, I learned about my own strength and courage. I didn&#39;t know I had it in me to buck the system by choosing unconventional therapies and doing it my way. But you see, I was never able to wrap my arms around the &#34;standard of care&#34; set forth by Western medicine as the way to treat cancer. When I was diagnosed with cancer, I needed to be emotionally strong to fight the battle. To help with that, I needed to be hormonally in balance. It is hard to be in a fighting mood when you are hormonally depressed. Balanced hormones keep your emotions in check and I believe (based on my research) are the most effective way to prevent cell proliferation (cancer). Unfortunately, Western medicine&#39;s &#34;standard of care&#34; believes that taking away all hormones prevents disease. I believed differently, so I didn&#39;t want to go off my bioidentical hormones. Nor did I want to undergo chemotherapy. You see, I do not believe in the &#34;poison&#34; theory of using chemotherapy. It is my belief that an environment of balanced hormones prevents disease. This is reinforced by many of the doctors interviewed in this book. For one thing, it ablates, or takes away, hormones. Chemotherapy does kill cancer cells, but it also kills the immune system. Without a strong immune system, cancer has a perfect opportunity to proliferate. We need a strong immune system, and balanced hormones to prevent disease. So it didn&#39;t make sense to me to &#34;take away&#34; hormones as a means to kill cancer. As I now see it, there are two ways to fight cancer: build up or destroy. Western medicine&#39;s standard of care is to destroy. Well-meaning though it may be, the idea of chemicalizing myself, destroying everything, and hoping my health would come back, coupled with the instructions to give up my hormone therapy, was not appealing. I decided to approach cancer by &#34;building up.&#34; This took courage, because it is daunting to go against the course recommended by one&#39;s doctor. But because of the books I write and my understanding of the hormonal connection to health, I had a lot of information. I understood that hormonal balance is key to health and vitality. My decision to go against the standard of care was probably easier for me than it would be for other women not armed with the same information. I approached my cancer through balanced bioidentical hormone replacement and complemented this replacement with Iscador, an anthroposophic medicine whose function is to strengthen and build up the immune system so that disease cannot attack and invade. I believe this was the best decision of my life. Aside from the discomfort of injecting myself with Iscador every other day for these five years, my health has never been better. I have not had so much as a cold during this time; upon my last checkup, my immune system was so high that my doctor was ecstatic. He said he had never seen an immune system this strong in any of his adult patients. That information was able to put all my fears to rest. How could a life-threatening illness get past an immune system this strong? Great. I had done it. I beat it. I did it my way, with my body almost intact. So you can imagine my surprise (five years and one month after my initial diagnosis) when my gynecologist told me that I had a pre-precancerous condition (not cancer, not even precancer) growing in my uterus and that in order to prevent possible severe problems down the road, I would need to have my uterus removed. Why was the sleeping giant trying to rear its ugly head again? Luckily we caught this before it became cancer, yet it was serious enough to force the removal of an organ. I do not take the removal of any body part lightly. What was wrong? I have thought about this a lot. As a teenage mother, I was given my first major chemical, a shot to dry up my milk, and was encouraged to feed my baby Similac formula. In chapter 5 I will discuss at length the protective aspects of breast-feeding and prolactin production. Second, at age eighteen I was put on the early high-dose birth control pills and stayed on them for twenty-two years. Unknowingly, like so many women of my generation, these chemicals put me into a false menopause. All those years of chemicalization were dangerous to my health. Add to this scenario stress and environmental assault and a brutal childhood and you have a recipe for disaster. The ninth year of bioidentical hormone replacement, things started going wonky (this is my term--don&#39;t expect your doctors to use it!). I had breakthrough bleeding, and then after a while I was bleeding continuously. Something was wrong, obviously. You must understand that because bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) is such a new science, all the medical professionals working in this arena are learning as fast as they can, but with each year we all learn more. At this point in my BHRT, I had not heard of &#34;rhythmic cycling,&#34; which I will explain in great detail later. In the way I was taking hormones on a static dose, my estrogen was not rising and falling as it once did in nature, and my progesterone was not rising and falling as it did when I was making a full complement of hormones in my youth. (See the diagram.) Because of this, my receptor sites were not opening to receive the progesterone, so the estrogen lining in my uterus kept building and building. Over time, like a motor on &#34;rev,&#34; this thinkening caused excessive bleeding and sent an alarm to my brain that &#34;all was not well,&#34; that this human being was no longer able to reproduce (which is why, according to nature, we exist). Because I was bleeding constantly, I was not ovulating. Thus I was not a reproductive person, according to my brain. You must understand that the object of bioidentical hormone replacement therapy is to fool the brain into thinking I can still make a baby, even though I have no eggs left. As a result of not having a rhythm, and of the thickening and the bleeding, severe hyperplasia, along with adenomyosis (leaks in my uterine lining), came about. This excessive bleeding and hyperplasia created a perfect scenario for cancer, so I had no choice but to remove my uterus, thus removing my problem. I now feel that had I not been chemicalized by the &#34;dry-up&#34; shot, and if I had not been on strong birth control pills, and if I had been cycling in a rhythmic fashion, this problem might not have occurred. This is a theory that I have embraced, as have several of the doctors I interviewed for this book. As you will also see in these interviews, there are other doctors who do not agree with rhythmic cycling or with cycling in general. My job is to give you all the information from these professionals so you can draw your own conclusions. I am not a doctor, but I am a very informed layperson. I will explain rhythmic cycling in detail in chapter 5, and you can then decide what makes the most sense to you. I am merely the messenger. Losing my uterus caused me to do a lot of searching. For years, I was unknowingly hormonally imbalanced, not just as a perimenopausal and menopausal woman, but also as a young woman. Unfortunately, I never realized hormonal imbalance was the problem. Without hormones or imbalanced hormones, we lose any grip on feeling &#34;normal.&#34; Without hormones, life quality is greatly diminished. Without hormones, a woman is at her weakest physically. Without hormones, disease is allowed to proliferate because the brain perceives that the body is no longer reproductive; therefore, nature wants to &#34;eliminate&#34; you to make way for those who are healthy and reproductive. Loss of hormones is not to be taken lightly. Having no hormones is like having bad premenstrual syndrome (PMS) every day of your life. You are not in control of your emotions, nor are you in control of the cruel physical manifestations of the loss of hormones. Couple this with the stress of having and fighting cancer, and (to me) it doesn&#39;t make sense to be without hormones. You see, we may have changed with the passing of time, but the biology inside us has not. Nature has a job to do, and the brain was hard-wired at the begining of time and doesn&#39;t know anything else. A healthy woman is hormonally balanced. We can&#39;t &#34;outthink&#34; nature. This never works, no matter how hard we try to come up with something better. Women remain confused about hormones and in some cases terrified of hormone replacement; one day, headlines in the newspapers praise hormone replacement therapy (HRT); the next day, the headlines are screaming that HRT will kill us. The truth is, despite the widespread use of synthetic hormone brands such as Premarin and Provera, these drugs have always been associated with cancer. The first cancer linked with synthetic hormone replacement was cancer of the uterus lining (endometrium). The most recent resurfacing of the negatives associated with synthetic hormones and cancer came from a government-sponsored study titled the Women&#39;s Health Initiative. This study was supposed to last 8.5 years, but it was stopped after only 5.2 years because the risks of using Premarin and Provera outweighed the benefits. Breast cancer was just one of the increased risks discovered. Additionally, the study concluded that synthetic hormone replacement therapy protects neither your bones nor your heart. Ironically, bone and heart protection were two of the primary benefits once used by doctors as selling points to get women to fill their prescriptions for these drugs. The Women&#39;s Health Initiative Study hoped to show decreases in *breast cancer *stroke *pulmonary embolism *colorectal cancer *endometrial cancer *hip fracture *death due to any cause The actual outcome results were shocking: *29 percent increase in coronary heart disease *41 percent increase in strokes *22 percent increase in cardiovascular disease *2,100 percent (yes, this is correct) increase in pulmonary embolism (lung blood clots) *26 percent increase in breast cancer So much for synthetic hormones! These statistics alone should convince you right away of the negative effects of these so-called synthetic hormones. Those of us who were on the original birth control pills for any length of time were actually on synthetic hormones- strong synthetic hormones. Any wonder why women of our generation are under siege from an epidemic of breast and ovarian cancers? There is a link, and you&#39;ll learn more about it in this book. Read on and see if you relate to my scenario: As I said, for twenty-two years, I was on synthetic birth control pills, the original ones that were very strong. I even manipulated my periods with them, if I didn&#39;t want to have a period on a particular weekend. I just didn&#39;t realize what was in those birth control pills, nor did I understand the dangers of messing with nature. I did not realize that having only a two-day bleed meant that I was not ovulating fully. At the time, I thought it was great to have such a light period. I did not realize that the importance of ovulation in the human female body is to let the brain know that I was well, healthy, and reproductive. As far as my brain was concerned, I was not reproductive because I was not fully ovulating. An ovulating woman is a reproductive woman. To believe that the body is not fully ovulating is a dangerous assumption for the brain to make. If the brain perceives us as unable to reproduce, its job, biologically speaking, is to try to eliminate us to make room for the reproductive ones. This is the nature in us. This is the template that was programmed in us from ancient times. Thus, this hormonal imbalance that I unknowingly put myself in was creating a backdrop for cancer. Why? Because we all have cancer in us, but as long as we are hormonally balanced, the brain perceives us as young, strong, and healthy. If we become imbalanced, this signals to the brain that the reproductive system is no longer in working order, and it is in this scenario that the cancer has a chance to come into being. You see, cancer proliferates in an environment of hormonal imbalance. This is why I believe that Western medicine&#39;s standard of care, well-meaning as it is, is treating us incorrectly. Western medicine is looking at everything except the obvious. Western medicine is trying to poison the cancer out of us, further wreaking havoc with our hormonal systems. Then, to prevent recurrence, we are given hormone ablation drugs such as tamoxifen or Femara, which interfere with the body&#39;s ability to read the hormones in some parts of the body. Plus, for many women these drugs cause horrible side effects. To me, it doesn&#39;t make sense to take any drug that prevents new hormones from being made in our bodies or to kill off any of the little bit of hormones we might have left. Why has Western medicine been trying to outthink nature? We are given fake hormones that don&#39;t replicate exactly what our bodies make naturally, and doctors are expecting them to work in the same way or better. It hasn&#39;t worked. Look around. Are the women you know doing well from midlife on? Most everyone has complaints, from mild to severe. No wonder women are in such bad shape. Once you understand the importance of your brain perceiving the body as reproductive--our &#34;brain template&#34;--it will be easier for you to make decisions for yourself. We assume that the professionals who are taking care of us know what they are doing. But they can&#39;t know what they haven&#39;t been taught, and unless you find yourself a doctor such as the ones</p><h2>Wish I Was Here: The World&#x2019;s Most Extraordinary Places on and Beyond the Seashore</h2><p><ul><li>The 20 best Instagram accounts and blogs illustrate paradise on earth - with the focus on the most idyllic beaches, azure seas, both above and below the water surface</li><li>A must-have for every adventurous globetrotter with a passion for the sea and water</li><li>In a 2016 travel survey, the top 10 dream vacations included Polynesia, the Amalfi Coast, the Greek Islands, the Galapagos Islands, and a world cruise</li></ul>Micronesia, Hawaii, Polynesia, Bora Bora, Seychelles, Maldives, Australia - where does the mind go when imagining such places.

Two receptionists, one on the phone. A Japanese guest check�ing in&#x2014;from his accent, obviously from Miyazaka in the south. A concierge printing a map for a couple of tourists. A security man, Eastern European, bored, standing by the door. He saw everything. If the lights had suddenly gone out, or if he had closed his eyes, he would have been able to continue forward at exactly the same pace.<br>&nbsp;Nobody noticed him. It was actually a skill, some�thing he had learned, the art of not being seen. Even the outfit he wore&#x2014;expensive jeans, a gray cashmere jersey, and a loose coat&#x2014;had been chosen because it made no statement at all. The clothes were well-known brands but he had cut out the labels. In the unlikely event that he was stopped by the police, it would be very difficult for them to know where they had been bought.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>He was twenty-eight years old. He had fair hair, cut short, and ice-cold eyes with just the faintest trace of blue. He was not large or well built, but there was a sort of sleekness about him. He moved like an athlete&#x2014;perhaps a sprinter approaching the starting blocks&#x2014;but there was asense of danger about him, a feeling that you should leave well alone. He carried three credit cards and a driver&#x2019;s license, issued in Swansea, all with the name Matthew Reddy. A police check would have established that he was a personal trainer, that he worked in a London gym and lived in Brixton. None of this was true. His real name was Yassen Gregorovich. He had been a professional assassin for almost half his life.<br>&nbsp;<br>The hotel was in King&#x2019;s Cross, an area of London with no attractive shops and few decent restaurants, a place where nobody really stays any longer than they have to. It was called The Traveller and it was part of a chain; comfortable but not too expensive. It was the sort of place that had no regular clients. Most of the guests were pass�ing through on business and it would be their companies who paid the bill. They drank in the bar. They ate the &#x201c;full English breakfast&#x201d; in the brightly lit Beefeater restaurant. But they were too busy to socialize and it was unlikely they would return. Yassen preferred it that way. He could have stayed in central London, in the Ritz or the Dorchester, but he knew that the receptionists there were trained to remember the faces of the people who passed through the revolving doors. Such personal attention was the last thing he wanted.<br>&nbsp;<br>A security camera watched him as he approached the elevators. He was aware of it blinking over his left shoul�der. The camera was annoying but inevitable. London has more of these devices than any city in Europe, and the police and secret service have access to all of them. Yassen made sure he didn&#x2019;t look up. If you look at a camera, that is when it sees you. He reached the elevators but ignored them, slipping through a fire door that led to the stairs. He would never think of confining himself in a small space, a metal box with doors that he couldn&#x2019;t open, sur�rounded by strangers. That would be madness. He would have walked fifteen stories if it had been necessary&#x2014;and when he reached the top, he wouldn&#x2019;t even have been out of breath. Yassen kept himself in superb condition, spend�ing two hours in the gym every day when that luxury was available to him, working out on his own when it wasn&#x2019;t.<br>&nbsp;<br>In fact, he was on the second floor. He had thoroughly checked the hotel on the Internet before he made his res�ervation, and number 217 was one of just four rooms that exactly met his demands. It was on the second floor, too high up to be reached from the street but low enough for him to jump out the window if he had to&#x2014;after shoot�ing out the glass. It was not overlooked. There were other buildings around, but any form of surveillance would be difficult. When Yassen went to bed, he never closed the curtains. He liked to see out, to watch for any movement in the street. Every city has a natural rhythm, and anything that breaks it&#x2014;a man lingering on a corner or a car pass�ing the same way twice&#x2014;might warn him that it was time to leave at once. And he never slept for more than four hours, not even in the most comfortable bed.<br>&nbsp;<br>A DO NOT DISTURB sign hung in front of him as he turned the corner and approached the door. Had it been obeyed? Yassen reached into his pants pocket and took out a small silver device, about the same size and shape as a pen. He pressed one end, covering the handle with a thin spray of diazafluoren&#x2014;a simple chemical re-agent. Quickly, he spun the pen around and pressed the other end, activating a fluorescent light. There were no finger�prints. If anyone had gone into the room since he had left, they had wiped the handle clean. He put the pen away, then knelt down and checked the bottom of the door. Ear�lier in the day, he had placed a single hair across the crack. It was one of the oldest warning signals in the book, but that didn&#x2019;t stop it from being effective. The hair was still in place. Yassen straightened up and went in using his elec�tronic pass key.<br>&nbsp;<br>It took him less than a minute to ascertain that every�thing was exactly as he had left it. His briefcase was 4.6 centimeters from the edge of the desk. His suitcase was positioned at a 95-degree angle from the wall. There were no fingerprints on either of the locks. He removed the dig�ital tape recorder that had been clipped magnetically to the side of his service fridge and glanced at the dial. Noth�ing had been recorded. Nobody had been in. Many people would have found all these precautions annoying and time consuming, but for Yassen they were as much a part of his daily routine as tying his shoelaces or brushing his teeth.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was twelve minutes past six when he sat down at the desk and opened his computer, an ordinary laptop. His password had seventeen digits and he changed it every month. He took off his watch and laid it on the surface beside him. Then he went into eBay, left-clicked on Col�lectibles, and scrolled through Coins. He soon found what he was looking for: a gold coin showing the head of the emperor Caligula with the date 11 AD. There had been no bids for this particular coin because, as any collector would know, it did not in fact exist. In 11 AD, the mad Roman emperor Caligula had not even been born. The entire website was a fake and looked it. The name of the coin dealer&#x2014;Mintomatic&#x2014;had been specially chosen to put off any casual purchaser. Mintomatic was supposedly based in Shanghai and did not have Top-Rated Seller sta�tus. All the coins it advertised were either fake or valueless.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yassen sat quietly until a quarter past six. At exactly the moment that the second hand passed over the twelve on his watch, he pressed the button to place a bid, then entered his User ID&#x2014;false, of course&#x2014;and password. Finally, he entered a bid of $2,418.12. The figures were based on the day&#x2019;s date and the exact time. He pressed Enter and a window opened that had nothing to do with eBay or with Roman coins. Nobody else could have seen it. It would have been impossible to discover where it had originated. The message had been bounced around a dozen countries, traveling through an anonymity network, before it had reached him. This is known as &#x201c;onion rout�ing&#x201d; because of its many layers. It had also passed through an encrypted tunnel, a secure shell that ensured that only Yassen could read what had been written. If someone had managed to arrive at the same screen by accident, they would have seen only nonsense, and within three seconds a virus would have entered their computer and obliter�ated the motherboard. The computer, however, had been authorized to receive the message, and Yassen saw three words.<br>&nbsp;<br>KILL ALEX RIDER<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>They were exactly what he had expected.</p><h2>Prayers to Strengthen Your Inner Man</h2><p>In this book, Mike Bickle teaches on the biblical necessity of praying for your own heart to be strengthened and enlightened by the Holy Spirit&#39;s power.

But Christopher Wright boldly maintains that there is a missional basis for the Bible! The entire Bible is generated by and all about God's mission. In order to understand the Bible, we need a missional hermeneutic, an interpretive perspective in tune with this great missional theme. We need to see how the familiar bits and pieces fit into the grand narrative of Scripture. Beginning with the Old Testament and its groundwork for understanding who God is, what he has called his people to be and do, and how the nations fit into God's mission, Wright gives us a new hermeneutical perspective on Scripture. This perspective provides a solid and expansive basis for holistic mission. God's mission is to reclaim the world&#x2015;including the created order&#x2015;and God's people have a designated role to play.</p><p>"A rich and most impressive work. It is a splendid exposition of a comprehensive biblical theology of mission, and will have to be taken seriously by every student of the subject." (Andrew F. Walls, Centre for the Study of World Christianity, University of Edinburgh)<br><br>"This marvelous book is all I hoped and expected, and more. It threatens to revolutionize what people usually mean by the missional aspect of the Scriptures. And it also threatens to revolutionize understandings of the Scriptures by its demonstration that they are, through and through, a missional document." (John Goldingay, David Allan Hubbard Professor of Old Testament, Fuller Theological)<br><br>&#x201c;This comprehensive study by a seasoned missiologist and Old Testament ethicist demonstrates that the entire Scripture is consistent in its message and thrust.

She opened her eyes for just an instant and saw the thick snow swirling beyond the windows of the house her father had rented, and for a fraction of an instant, she wanted to roll over and go back to sleep. She could hear the dynamite blasts in the distance to prevent avalanches, and just from a glance, she knew what kind of day it was. You could hardly see past the windows in the heavy blizzard, and she knew that if the mountain was open, it wouldn&#x2019;t be for long. But she loved the challenge of skiing in heavy snow. It would be a good workout, and she didn&#x2019;t want to miss a single day with one of her favorite instructors, Jason Yee.<br><br>She and her father came here every year during Christmas break. They celebrated Christmas at home in Denver, flew to San Francisco where her father visited friends and did some business, mostly with venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, and then they drove to Squaw. It was a tradition Lily loved, and good skiing. They&#x2019;d been coming here since she&#x2019;d started downhill racing when she was a little kid. She had won bronze in the Junior Olympics three years before, at fourteen. And she was training for the next Winter Olympics, in a year. This time she was hoping to win the gold.<br><br>Lily gave a last stretch in her warm, comfortable bed and got up to take a shower. She glanced out the window and saw how heavy the snowfall was. There were two more feet of fresh snow on the ground than there had been the night before. She grinned, thinking of the morning that lay ahead. The heavy snow might slow them down a little, but Jason always pushed her hard, which was what she liked about him. She loved skiing with him, and he was more fun than her regular Denver coach, who&#x2019;d been training her for the Olympics since she was twelve.<br><br>It had been her father&#x2019;s idea for her to start skiing, and then racing, when he saw what a natural she was. He had loved to ski at her age. He had been mostly self-�taught, and had a passion for it, and had skied on whatever skis he could afford. After his simple beginnings in a mining town in Pennsylvania, he had made his fortune in his early twenties, speculating on the commodities market and later investing in high-�risk deals that brought enormous returns. Since then he had been investing more conservatively, and his fortune was secure and would go to Lily one day. She never thought about it, although she knew how fortunate she was. Her father always preached discipline and hard work, and Lily was a lot like him. She was an outstanding student and a talented athlete. She was a junior in high school and hoped to go to an Ivy League college. And in the meantime she trained for the Olympics every day, at a grueling pace. She had been the joy and main focus of her father&#x2019;s life since her mother died when she was three. Bill Thomas lived for her, and Lily adored him.<br><br>Bill Thomas had gone to a state college in Pennsylvania. His father had been a coal miner and died when Bill was in his teens. He knew what poverty looked like at its most extreme, and all he had wanted as a young man was to provide a better life for the family he hoped to have one day. A scholarship to Harvard Business School had changed his life. He had used the MBA he earned there, and his own entrepreneurial sense, to achieve everything he had set his sights on as a boy. His mother never lived to see him graduate, and his brother had died in a mine accident at nineteen. Only Bill had escaped into a better world, and he never forgot where he came from, and what he had achieved. He was brilliant in business, and at fifty-�two, he had fulfilled his dreams, and worked at home now, managing his investments, and spending as much time with Lily as he could. He had been both father and mother to her for fourteen years, and was infinitely proud of her.<br><br>Lily showered and dressed, and appeared at the breakfast table a few minutes later, in her ski pants, thermals, and bare feet. Her long dark hair was still wet from the shower, and her father was sipping a cup of coffee, as he looked up at her with a smile.<br><br>&#x201c;I was wondering if you were going to sleep in. It looks nasty outside.&#x201d; As he said it, they both heard the dynamite go off again. The chairlifts weren&#x2019;t moving yet, but Lily was sure they would soon, at least for a while.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to miss the day,&#x201d; she said, putting brown sugar on the oatmeal he had ordered for her, from room service at a nearby hotel that provided food and maid service to the house they rented every year. &#x201c;I love skiing with Jason, Daddy,&#x201d; she said, as he uncovered the rest of what he&#x2019;d ordered for her, scrambled eggs, bacon, and whole wheat toast. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t eat all that,&#x201d; she said, making a face.<br><br>Lily was lean and athletic and in fantastic shape, and she was as beautiful as her mother had been, with the same lavender-�blue eyes, dark hair, and creamy skin, and a wide smile that mirrored his own. Bill was as fair as she was dark and looked younger than his years. He had never remarried and had no desire to, as long as Lily was at home. He had dated the same woman for the past two years. Penny was devoted to her career, had never married, and had no children, and she traveled so much for her PR business that it never bothered her that the most important woman in Bill&#x2019;s life was Lily, and most of the time he was busy with his daughter and had little interest in anyone else. He and Penny had an unspoken arrangement that worked for both of them. When they had time and were in the same city, they spent an evening together, and other than that, they had their own lives. Neither of them wanted more with each other than they had. And they had fun whenever they got together.<br><br>Penny was a good-�looking redhead, and she worked hard at maintaining a spectacular body that she had &#x201c;enhanced&#x201d; here and there. Bill always enjoyed having her on his arm when they went out. She was younger than he was, but not so much that he felt foolish when they were seen together.<br><br>They had even managed a couple of trips, usually to resorts she represented so she could kill two birds with one stone. He had never suggested a future to her, nor did he plan to, and she was an independent woman who didn&#x2019;t seem to want one with him, or anyone else. She was forty-�two years old, and Lily liked her, and knew that Penny was no threat to her. Her father rarely in- volved his daughter in his dating life&#x2014;�they spent their family time alone, as on this vacation. And during their time in Squaw, Penny was at the opening of a new resort in St. Bart&#x2019;s, and Bill had never invited her to Squaw Valley with them on their annual trip. He liked spending the time with Lily&#x2014;�she was so busy with school and friends, sports, and after-�school activities when they were at home. He dreaded when she&#x2019;d leave for college and was trying to talk her into going to school in or near Denver, although Lily had her heart set on the Ivy League in the East, and had the grades to get in.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you sure you want to go out today?&#x201d; he asked, as she took a bite of the eggs and then nibbled a strip of bacon.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll probably close the mountain early. I want to get in as many runs as I can before they do,&#x201d; she said, then stood up to go finish dressing.<br><br>&#x201c;If it gets too bad, I want you to come in,&#x201d; he reminded her. He admired her skill, and her discipline, but he didn&#x2019;t want her taking crazy chances in ugly weather. But she was a sensible girl too.<br><br>&#x201c;I know, Daddy,&#x201d; she said with a dazzling smile as she looked over her shoulder. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, we&#x2019;ll be fine. Jason knows the mountain better than anyone here.&#x201d; It was one of the reasons why Bill had hired him years before. He wanted Lily to have fun, but he wanted her safe above all. He had lost her mother and didn&#x2019;t want to lose her as well. Lily&#x2019;s mother had been driving too fast the night she hit a patch of ice in Denver and died at twenty-�five, leaving Bill widowed, with a three-�year-�old child. He protected Lily as if she were made of glass.<br><br>She was back ten minutes later, with her sweater on over her thermals, ski pants, hiking boots, and her Olympic team parka and helmet over her arm. She left her skis, boots, and poles in a locker at the base of the mountain every night, and she had to take a shuttle bus to meet Jason there now. She put her parka on and zipped it up. Bill was sitting at his computer checking the commodities market, and then looked up at her with a grin.<br><br>&#x201c;You look mighty cute,&#x201d; he said, smiling broadly. The Olympic team parka and helmet said she was a hotshot, and they were a status symbol on any slope. Just looking at her, he was proud of her all over again. &#x201c;And come in if the weather gets any worse,&#x201d; he reminded her, and she bent to kiss him on the top of his head on her way out.<br><br>&#x201c;We will,&#x201d; she said happily, and waved her gloves at him from the doorway, and then she was off to get in as much skiing as she could before the mountain closed. He was sure it would by midday, and so was she.<br><br>He stood up and watched her from the window, and saw her get on the shuttle bus to the base. She didn&#x2019;t see him, and he felt his heart tug as he gazed at her. She was so beautiful and so young, and she looked so much like her late mother they could have been sisters. It still tore his heart out sometimes. She would have been thirty-�nine years old if she were still alive, which was hard to imagine. In his mind, she would be young forever, hardly older than Lily was now at seventeen. He went back to his computer then, and hoped that Lily would come in early. The snow seemed to be getting worse, and he knew there would be a veil of fog at the top of the mountain. Only the worst diehards would venture out today, like Lily. She had her mother&#x2019;s looks but her father&#x2019;s grit, stubbornness, and determination. Because of it, Bill was sure that her skill and relentless training would win her the gold in the next Olympics.<br><br>While riding the shuttle to the base, she had time to text her boyfriend Jeremy and best friend Veronica. Both were on the ski team with her, and were practicing in Denver that day. She had no time to make friends with anyone who wasn&#x2019;t on the Olympic team, and she and Veronica had known each other since nursery school. Jeremy answered her with a quick &#x201c;I love you.&#x201d; Veronica didn&#x2019;t answer, and Lily guessed she was still asleep.<br><br>Lily met Jason, as promised, at the lockers. He was wearing his ski school jacket, and next to her Olympic team gear, they looked very official, as they put their skis and boots on, left their shoes in a locker, grabbed their poles, and headed toward the lift. They were both wearing goggles in the heavy snow. Jason glanced at her with a grin, as they showed their passes to the chairlift operator and he nodded. There were three other people waiting for the lift ahead of them, and it had just started operating only minutes before. Two others were already high in the air on the chairs as Lily glanced at them. It was exhilarating to be out on a day like this, and she loved the challenge of skiing through the heavy snow. Jason admired that about her&#x2014;�nothing ever stopped her.<br><br>&#x201c;You either have to be crazy to go out on a day like this,&#x201d; Jason said, laughing, &#x201c;or very young, or both. I don&#x2019;t think the mountain will be open long.&#x201d; But they both knew it was safe, if the chairlift was operating, otherwise they&#x2019;d have closed it down. And only the most skilled would brave the mountain today, and she and Jason both qualified for that. He was an astounding skier, and so was she. He had won national championships at her age, and he was an excellent teacher too. She always learned something new from him, which added to what she learned from her Denver coach, who was a taskmaster.<br><br>&#x201c;I guess that means I&#x2019;m crazy,&#x201d; Lily said happily. &#x201c;My dad thinks we&#x2019;re nuts too.&#x201d; They could hear the dynamite blasting again, as Lily got on the first available chairlift, and Jason waited for the next one, right behind her. Lily felt the same thrill she always did, as the chairlift went high in the air, and she looked down at the trees and virgin snow. There was not a single skier yet on the slopes, and she could tell that part of the mountain was closed as they headed toward the top. The wind was whipping her face, and she enjoyed the peaceful silence as the chairlift hummed along, and then she heard another crack of dynamite, unusually close by. It sounded like they were right next to it, which surprised her, and at exactly the same moment, as they approached a ravine, from a great height, she saw a long snake whip through the air, like a giant rope above their heads. She looked up at it and felt her- self falling fast at the same time. She didn&#x2019;t even have time to understand that the cable that held the chairlift had just broken, as she plummeted down, into a deep hole in the snow. When she landed, all she saw was white, and her eyes closed as she fell into a deep sleep. She never had time to turn and look at Jason, while they free-�fell past the trees, and he landed in the ravine. Jason was dead the minute he hit the snow.</p><h2>Why The Best Are The Best: 25 Powerful Words That Impact, Inspire, And Define Champions</h2><p>Winning the NBA Championship in 2008.<br>Losing in the NBA Finals<br>in 2010.

The Foreign Exchange category is mostly crowded with two types of books:<br>&nbsp;<br><ol> <li>Theoretical textbooks on international finance, the mechanics of the foreign exchange market and/or the principles of long-term currency valuation; and</li> <li>How-to books written by non-professionals, usually with the word "forex" in the title. These books tend to rely on a one-dimensional overemphasis of simple, short-term technical patterns while ignoring fundamentals, psychology, positioning and proper risk management.</li></ol>&nbsp;<br>I have written this book to fill the void, so you can learn FX trading from a real professional. THE ART OF CURRENCY TRADING is a synthesis of everything I have learned in more than twenty years as a professional trader and interbank market maker in FX.<br>Trading, like baseball, poker, golf or any other highly-skilled pursuit, can be a game not of inches but of millimeters. Small improvements in your decision-making process can yield large improvements in profitability. This book will give you the insights you need to break through and achieve a higher level of success. Currency trading is like playing the piano. The mechanics are very simple (just press a few keys!) but mastery takes a lifetime.<br><br>The book builds in intensity and depth one topic at a time with the goal of enlightening and educating the most experienced, expert FX trader without leaving beginners in the dust. If you are early in your FX trading career, you should find all the building blocks for success here and if you are already an experienced FX trader, you should find a ton of new ideas and inspiration to take your game to the next level.<br><br>Most trading books tend to focus on one school of trading thought, whether it's technical analysis, macro fundamentals, behavioral finance, psychology or risk management. That approach is too one-dimensional. To succeed in FX, you need to master the fusion approach and use multiple types of analysis to reach stronger conclusions and then understand your own psychology and risk management to trade with higher confidence. When every branch of analysis points in the same direction, you have found an extremely high probability setup--A Five-Star Trade.<br><br>I have experience trading interest rates, equities and commodities so this book will frequently refer to these products. Experienced traders from outside the world of FX will learn a great deal from this book because entire sections (e.g., risk management, trading psychology, The Seven Deadly Setups) apply to trading in any asset class. Please note, however, that my main objective is to increase your expertise specifically in the foreign exchange market.<br><br>This book will present a variety of unique approaches and specific trading techniques that I hope will open some new doors in your mind. Every trading book and every hour spent behind the screens is part of an overall trading education. I don't claim to have the holy grail or a simple, foolproof strategy for guaranteed profits in forex. There is no such thing. Trading is a lifelong pursuit and this book should be one step in your ongoing education. Absorb what resonates with you and ignore what does not. Develop your own style. Learn as much as you can from this book but do not copy my approach or anyone else's. Be an independent thinker.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>Why I wrote this book</b><br>&nbsp;<br>When I was in my 20s, I used to greet most trading books with cynicism. I would think something like: "If you're such a great trader, why would you write a book about it? Aren't you giving away all your secrets? And anyway, what do you need money from writing a book for? Shouldn't you be rich already from your superhuman trading skills?"<br><br>Let me answer.<br><br>First of all, there are no secrets to trading. Only knowledge, skill, experience and psychology. And even if I share all my knowledge, skill and experience, the psychology bit is by far the hardest part. You can master all the skills, tactics and strategies and you will still fail if you cannot control yourself. And besides, currency markets are huge. Five trillion dollars a day transact in FX. There is always room for a few more skilled traders. I do not mind sharing what I know at this point. There is no downside for me.<br><br>And about the money: You don't get rich writing non-fiction books. The reason I wrote this book is simply because I love to write. And because I love trading. And I think that after more than 20 years of trading, I have something interesting to say about trading generally and currency markets specifically.<br><br>I hope you agree.<br><br>This book will show you how to come up with intelligent trade ideas using macro fundamental and technical analysis, market psychology, positioning, sentiment and cross-market correlation. You will learn exactly how to trade the news and economic events. And you will understand the importance of rigorous and systematic risk management.<br><br>The book starts with the basics of currency trading and quickly builds to more advanced concepts. While the book works for beginners and quickly brings them up to speed before introducing more advanced topics, my intention is that The Art of Currency Trading will appeal to and educate even the most expert and experienced FX trader.<br><br>Remember: Anyone can learn the rules. Very few can stick to them. Even after more than two decades of trading, I still struggle to stay disciplined and unemotional each day. It is easy to make stupid mistakes, show poor self-control and go on tilt, no matter how experienced you are. <br><br>Each day you walk in to trade the currency market, you battle not just countless algorithms, Ivy-league educated hedge fund professionals, machine learning bots, highly-experienced interbank traders, central banks, veteran corporate and real money hedgers, and skilled retail traders. You battle yourself. And even when you win the internal battle and show great self-discipline, every victory is temporary. You must constantly adapt to an ever changing and highly efficient market.<br><br>This book will make you a better currency trader. It will help you understand what moves currency markets, show you how to generate profitable trade ideas, and teach you expert execution methods. This book will help you master foreign exchange trading and achieve sustainable long-term trading success. This book will help you make more money.

But this one stands out because it's for young people who are looking to build savings and wealth over the long term.<br>When the editorial team at Adams Media and I started working on this project we knew we had to do something different than what's already out there.&nbsp; We knew we had to deliver a tool that made sense in today's world of social media, crazy politics, and fast moving information.<br>And that's exactly what we did.&nbsp; We made the topics accessible. We redesigned the format so you could find what you want fast.&nbsp; And we covered all the important topics required to set the reader on the right path to build their financial future.<br>So while all this information is in a book format, "The Everything Guide to Investing in Your 20s and 30s" is actually a detailed and immediately actionable plan designed to consistently build savings and wealth through an entire lifetime.&nbsp;<br>It all starts with a budget, adding building blocks such as mutual funds, stocks, and real estate and how to steadily gain success and avoid pitfalls. And along the way there are great examples of how to reach success.<br>My favorite part of the book is the section on how to spot a great company.&nbsp; In this edition I described how a small family owned restaurant founded by a single mother became a premium global steakhouse and how this successful chain runs its business almost like the founder to this day.&nbsp; I'll give you a hint, they are from New Orleans, and the founder's name was Ruth.<br>Most important, I made sure that the information you read includes which Apps are the best to plan budgets, do your research, gather news, and keep up with your portfolio or your properties.&nbsp;<br>Indeed, this book its all about designing, adjusting, and keeping up with your financial plan via the portability of a mobile phone or your laptop and how to avoid getting ripped off by clever marketing scams along the way.<br>In short, all I can say is I wish I had read this book when I was in my&nbsp; 20s and I hope it makes readers well informed and hopefully wealthy.<br>Thanks to all who read my books.Joe DuarteJoe Duarte is a market analyst, trader, investor, and money manager.

No woman, in twenty centuries, ever wielded more power and influence in the Vatican.When Josefine Lehnert entered Holy Cross Convent [Menzinger, Switzerland] she was given the name &#x201c;Pascalina.&#x201d; In 1917, the beautiful young nun from Bavaria and two other Sisters were sent to Munich to organize and maintain the nunciature. The Holy See&#x2019;s newly appointed Nuncio to Bavaria was 41-year-old Eugenio Pacelli. For the rest his diplomatic career, Schwester Pascalina would remain his personal secretary, housekeeper and ne plus ultra confidante. When Pacelli was recalled to Rome in 1929 and subsequently made a cardinal and appointed Secretary of State, he requested that Sister Pascalina be permitted to continue working with him. She was the first woman ever to reside in the Apostolic Palace. In 1939, on the first ballot and by a unanimous [minus one] vote, Eugenio Pacelli became the world&#x2019;s 260th Pope; the twelfth to take the name &#x201c;Pius.&#x201d;Romanit� &#x2014;an unofficial yet rigorous ecclesiastical/Italianate protocol that permeates diplomacy to this day&#x2014; saw fit to &#x201c;promote&#x201d; the new pontiff&#x2019;s secretary. Henceforth, &#x201c;Sister&#x201d; Pascalina was &#x201c;Mother&#x201d; Pascalina. Strong woman that she was, &#x201c;La Madre&#x201d; was keenly and constantly aware of the tightrope she was walking &#x2014;and more so of the snake pit just below it. As the pope&#x2019;s closest confidante, she strove for anonymity; kept any opinion she might have had on any matter, private or public, strictly to herself; avoided photographers and journalists like the plague and &#x2014;perhaps most challengingly of all&#x2014; ignored every cruel rumor and innuendo, never dignifying one of them with a response.Undoubtedly, Pope Pius XII was a giant among men; an outstanding intellectual; a savior to countless victims of World War II; a courageous advocate for the voiceless; a born leader who understood a complicated world and its leaders, good and evil; a Pope worthy to be called &#x201c;Great&#x201d;.It is said that &#x201c;Behind ever great man is a great woman.&#x201d; The history of Pope Pius XII and Mother Pascalina requires one very important word change to that maxim: &#x201c;Beside every great man stands a great woman.&#x201d;</p><p></p><h2>Fundamentals of English Grammar Student Book with App, 5e (5th Edition)</h2><p><p>Using a time-tested approach that has helped millions of students around the world, <i>Fundamentals of English Grammar</i> blends direct grammar instruction with carefully sequenced practice to developspeaking, writing, listening, and reading skills. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The fifth edition has been extensively revised to keep pace with advances in theory and practice, particularly from cognitive science.

I&#x2019;m sorry I can&#x2019;t properly introduce myself, but I don&#x2019;t have a name anymore. Hardly any of us do. We lose them like car keys, forget them like anniversaries. Mine might have started with an &#x201c;R,&#x201d; but that&#x2019;s all I have now. It&#x2019;s funny because back when I was alive, I was always forgetting <i>other</i> people&#x2019;s names. My friend &#x201c;M&#x201d; says the irony of being a zombie is that everything is funny, but you can&#x2019;t smile, because your lips have rotted off.<br> <br>None of us are particularly attractive, but death has been kinder to me than some. I&#x2019;m still in the early stages of decay. Just the gray skin, the unpleasant smell, the dark circles under my eyes. I could almost pass for a Living man in need of a vacation. Before I became a zombie I must have been a businessman, a banker or broker or some young temp learning the ropes, because I&#x2019;m wearing fairly nice clothes. Black slacks, gray shirt, red tie. M makes fun of me sometimes. He points at my tie and tries to laugh, a choked, gurgling rumble deep in his gut. His clothes are holey jeans and a plain white T-shirt. The shirt is looking pretty macabre by now. He should have picked a darker color.<br> <br>We like to joke and speculate about our clothes, since these final fashion choices are the only indication of who we were before we became no one. Some are less obvious than mine: shorts and a sweater, skirt and a blouse. So we make random guesses.<br> <br>You were a waitress. You were a student. Ring any bells?<br> <br>It never does.<br> <br>No one I know has any specific memories. Just a vague, vestigial knowledge of a world long gone. Faint impressions of past lives that linger like phantom limbs. We recognize civilization&#x2014;buildings, cars, a general overview&#x2014;but we have no personal role in it. No history. We are just <i>here</i>. We do what we do, time passes, and no one asks questions. But like I&#x2019;ve said, it&#x2019;s not so bad. We may appear mindless, but we aren&#x2019;t. The rusty cogs of cogency still spin, just geared down and down till the outer motion is barely visible. We grunt and groan, we shrug and nod, and sometimes a few words slip out. It&#x2019;s not that different from before.<br> <br>But it does make me sad that we&#x2019;ve forgotten our names. Out of everything, this seems to me the most tragic. I miss my own and I mourn for everyone else&#x2019;s, because I&#x2019;d like to love them, but I don&#x2019;t know who they are.<br> <br> � � � <br> <br>There are hundreds of us living in an abandoned airport outside some large city. We don&#x2019;t need shelter or warmth, obviously, but we like having the walls and roofs over our heads. Otherwise we&#x2019;d just be wandering in an open field of dust somewhere, and that would be horrifying. To have nothing at all around us, nothing to touch or look at, no hard lines whatsoever, just us and the gaping maw of the sky. I imagine that&#x2019;s what being full-dead is like. An emptiness vast and absolute.<br> <br>I think we&#x2019;ve been here a long time. I still have all my flesh, but there are elders who are little more than skeletons with clinging bits of muscle, dry as jerky. Somehow it still extends and contracts, and they keep moving. I have never seen any of us &#x201c;die&#x201d; of old age. Left alone with plenty of food, maybe we&#x2019;d &#x201c;live&#x201d; forever, I don&#x2019;t know. The future is as blurry to me as the past. I can&#x2019;t seem to make myself care about anything to the right or left of the present, and the present isn&#x2019;t exactly urgent. You might say death has relaxed me.<br> <br> � � � <br> <br>I am riding the escalators when M finds me. I ride the escalators several times a day, whenever they move. It&#x2019;s become a ritual. The airport is derelict, but the power still flickers on sometimes, maybe flowing from emergency generators stuttering deep underground. Lights flash and screens blink, machines jolt into motion. I cherish these moments. The feeling of things coming to life. I stand on the steps and ascend like a soul into Heaven, that sugary dream of our childhoods, now a tasteless joke.<br> <br>After maybe thirty repetitions, I rise to find M waiting for me at the top. He is hundreds of pounds of muscle and fat draped on a six-foot-five frame. Bearded, bald, bruised and rotten, his grisly visage slides into view as I crest the staircase summit. Is he the angel that greets me at the gates? His ragged mouth is oozing black drool.<br> <br>He points in a vague direction and grunts, &#x201c;City.&#x201d;<br> <br>I nod and follow him.<br> <br>We are going out to find food. A hunting party forms around us as we shuffle toward town. It&#x2019;s not hard to find recruits for these expeditions, even if no one is hungry. Focused thought is a rare occurrence here, and we all follow it when it manifests. Otherwise we&#x2019;d just be standing around and groaning all day. We do a lot of standing around and groaning. Years pass this way. The flesh withers on our bones and we stand here, waiting for it to go. I often wonder how old I am.<br> <br> � � � <br> <br>The city where we do our hunting is conveniently close. We arrive around noon the next day and start looking for flesh. The new hunger is a strange feeling. We don&#x2019;t feel it in our stomachs&#x2014;some of us don&#x2019;t even have those. We feel it everywhere equally, a sinking, sagging sensation, as if our cells are deflating. Last winter, when so many Living joined the Dead and our prey became scarce, I watched some of my friends become full-dead. The transition was undramatic. They just slowed down, then stopped, and after a while I realized they were corpses. It disquieted me at first, but it&#x2019;s against etiquette to notice when one of us dies. I distracted myself with some groaning.<br> <br>I think the world has mostly ended, because the cities we wander through are as rotten as we are. Buildings have collapsed. Rusted cars clog the streets. Most glass is shattered, and the wind drifting through the hollow high-rises moans like an animal left to die. I don&#x2019;t know what happened. Disease? War? Social collapse? Or was it just us? The Dead replacing the Living? I guess it&#x2019;s not so important. Once you&#x2019;ve arrived at the end of the world, it hardly matters which route you took.<br> <br>We start to smell the Living as we approach a dilapidated apartment building. The smell is not the musk of sweat and skin, it&#x2019;s the effervescence of life energy, like the ionized tang of lightning and lavender. We don&#x2019;t smell it in our noses. It hits us deeper inside, near our brains, like wasabi. We converge on the building and crash our way inside.<br> <br>We find them huddled in a small studio unit with the windows boarded up. They are dressed worse than we are, wrapped in filthy tatters and rags, all of them badly in need of a shave. M will be saddled with a short blond beard for the rest of his Fleshy existence, but everyone else in our party is cleanshaven. It&#x2019;s one of the perks of being dead, another thing we don&#x2019;t have to worry about anymore. Beards, hair, toenails... no more fighting biology. Our wild bodies have finally been tamed.<br> <br>Slow and clumsy but with unswerving commitment, we launch ourselves at the Living. Shotgun blasts fill the dusty air with gunpowder and gore. Black blood spatters the walls. The loss of an arm, a leg, a portion of torso, this is disregarded, shrugged off. A minor cosmetic issue. But some of us take shots to our brains, and we drop. Apparently there&#x2019;s still something of value in that withered gray sponge because if we lose it, we are corpses. The zombies to my left and right hit the ground with moist thuds. But there are plenty of us. We are overwhelming. We set upon the Living, and we eat.<br> <br>Eating is not a pleasant business. I chew off a man&#x2019;s arm, and I hate it. I hate his screams, because I don&#x2019;t like pain, I don&#x2019;t like hurting people, but this is the world now. This is what we do. Of course if I don&#x2019;t eat all of him, if I spare his brain, he&#x2019;ll rise up and follow me back to the airport, and that might make me feel better. I&#x2019;ll introduce him to everyone, and maybe we&#x2019;ll stand around and groan for a while. It&#x2019;s hard to say what &#x201c;friends&#x201d; are anymore, but that might be close. If I restrain myself, if I leave enough...<br> <br>But I don&#x2019;t. I can&#x2019;t. As always I go straight for the good part, the part that makes my head light up like a picture tube. I eat the brain, and for about thirty seconds, I have memories. Flashes of parades, perfume, music... <i>life</i>. Then it fades, and I get up, and we all stumble out of the city, still cold and gray, but feeling a little better. Not &#x201c;good,&#x201d; exactly, not &#x201c;happy,&#x201d; certainly not &#x201c;alive,&#x201d; but... a little less dead. This is the best we can do.<br> <br>I trail behind the group as the city disappears behind us. My steps plod a little heavier than the others&#x2019;. When I pause at a rain-filled pothole to scrub gore off my face and clothes, M drops back and slaps a hand on my shoulder. He knows my distaste for some of our routines. He knows I&#x2019;m a little more sensitive than most. Sometimes he teases me, twirls my messy black hair into pigtails and says, &#x201c;Girl. Such... girl.&#x201d; But he knows when to take my gloom seriously. He pats my shoulder and just looks at me. His face isn&#x2019;t capable of much expressive nuance anymore, but I know what he wants to say. I nod, and we keep walking.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know why we have to kill people. I don&#x2019;t know what chewing through a man&#x2019;s neck accomplishes. I steal what he has to replace what I lack. He disappears, and I stay. It&#x2019;s simple but senseless, arbitrary laws from some lunatic legislator in the sky. But following those laws keeps me walking, so I follow them to the letter. I eat until I stop eating, then I eat again.<br> <br>How did this start? How did we become what we are? Was it some mysterious virus? Gamma rays? An ancient curse? Or something even more absurd? No one talks about it much. We are here, and this is the way it is. We don&#x2019;t complain. We don&#x2019;t ask questions. We go about our business.<br> <br>There is a chasm between me and the world outside of me. A gap so wide my feelings can&#x2019;t cross it. By the time my screams reach the other side, they have dwindled into groans.<br> <br> � � � <br> <br>At the Arrivals gate, we are greeted by a small crowd, watching us with hungry eyes or eyesockets. We drop our cargo on the floor: two mostly intact men, a few meaty legs, and a dismembered torso, all still warm. Call it leftovers. Call it takeout. Our fellow Dead fall on them and feast right there on the floor like animals. The life remaining in those cells will keep them from full-dying, but the Dead who don&#x2019;t hunt will never quite be satisfied. Like men at sea deprived of fresh fruit, they will wither in their deficiencies, weak and perpetually empty, because the new hunger is a lonely monster. It grudgingly accepts the brown meat and lukewarm blood, but what it craves is closeness, that grim sense of connection that courses between their eyes and ours in those final moments, like some dark negative of love.<br> <br>I wave to M and then break free from the crowd. I have long since acclimated to the Dead&#x2019;s pervasive stench, but the reek rising off them today feels especially fetid. Breathing is optional, but I need some air.<br> <br>I wander out into the connecting hallways and ride the conveyors. I stand on the belt and watch the scenery scroll by through the window wall. Not much to see. The runways are turning green, overrun with grass and brush. Jets lie motionless on the concrete like beached whales, white and monumental. Moby Dick, conquered at last.<br> <br>Before, when I was alive, I could never have done this. Standing still, watching the world pass by me, thinking about nearly nothing. I remember effort. I remember targets and deadlines, goals and ambitions. I remember being <i>purposeful</i>, always everywhere all the time. Now I&#x2019;m just standing here on the conveyor, along for the ride. I reach the end, turn around, and go back the other way. The world has been distilled. Being dead is easy.<br> <br>After a few hours of this, I notice a female on the opposite conveyor. She doesn&#x2019;t lurch or groan like most of us; her head just lolls from side to side. I like that about her, that she doesn&#x2019;t lurch or groan. I catch her eye and stare at her as we approach. For a brief moment we are side by side, only a few feet away. We pass, then travel on to opposite ends of the hall. We turn around and look at each other. We get back on the conveyors. We pass each other again. I grimace and she grimaces back. On our third pass, the airport power dies, and we come to a halt perfectly aligned. I wheeze hello, and she responds with a hunch of her shoulder.<br> <br>I like her. I reach out and touch her hair. Like me, her decomposition is at an early stage. Her skin is pale and her eyes are sunken, but she has no exposed bones or organs. Her irises are an especially light shade of that strange pewter gray all the Dead share. Her graveclothes are a black skirt and a snug white buttonup. I suspect she used to be a receptionist.<br> <br>Pinned to her chest is a silver nametag.<br> <br>She has a name.<br> <br>I stare hard at the tag; I lean in close, putting my face inches from her breasts, but it doesn&#x2019;t help. The letters spin and reverse in my vision; I can&#x2019;t hold them down. As always, they elude me, just a series of meaningless lines and blots.<br> <br>Another of M&#x2019;s undead ironies&#x2014;from nametags to newspapers, the answers to our questions are written all around us, and we don&#x2019;t know how to read.<br> <br>I point at the tag and look her in the eyes. &#x201c;Your... name?&#x201d;<br> <br>She looks at me blankly.<br> <br>I point at myself and pronounce the remaining fragment of my own name. &#x201c;Rrr.&#x201d; Then I point at her again.<br> <br>Her eyes drop to the floor. She shakes her head. She doesn&#x2019;t remember. She doesn&#x2019;t even have syllable one, like M and I do. She is no one. But don&#x2019;t I always expect too much? I reach out and take her hand. We walk off the conveyers with our arms stretched across the divider.<br> <br>This female and I have fallen in love. Or what&#x2019;s left of it.<br> <br>I think I remember what love was like before. There were complex emotional and biological factors. We had elaborate tests to pass, connections to forge, ups and downs and tears and whirlwinds. It was an ordeal, an exercise in agony, but it was alive. The new love is simpler. Easier. But small.<br> <br>My girlfriend doesn&#x2019;t talk much. We walk through the echoing corridors of the airport, occasionally passing someone staring out a window or at a wall. I try to think of things to say but nothing comes, and if something did come I probably couldn&#x2019;t say it. This is my great obstacle, the biggest of all the boulders littering my path. In my mind I am eloquent; I can climb intricate scaffolds of words to reach the highest cathedral ceilings and paint my thoughts. But when I open my mouth, it all collapses. So far my personal record is four rolling syllables before some... thing... jams. And I may be the most loquacious zombie in this airport.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know why we don&#x2019;t speak. I can&#x2019;t explain the suffocating silence that hangs over our world, cutting us off from each other like prison-visit Plexiglas. Prepositions are painful, articles are arduous, adjectives are wild overachievements. Is this muteness a real physical handicap? One of the many symptoms of being Dead? Or do we just have nothing left to say?<br> <br>I attempt conversation with my girlfriend, testing out a few awkward phrases and shallow que...</p><h2>First Time Sewing with a Serger: The Absolute Beginner&#39;s Guide--Learn By Doing * Step-by-Step Basics + 9 Projects (Volume 8) (First Time, 8)</h2><p><b>In <i>First Time Sewing with a Serger</i>, sewing experts Becky Hanson and Beth Baumgartel take you by the hand and teach you everything you need to know to sew with a serger, or overlock machine&#x2014;a versatile and speedy stitching tool. </b><br><br> Start by learning how a serger works, the many styles available, and the roles of various parts&nbsp;and accessories.

I&#x2019;d heard that question as I passed at least three other groups of students. People I&#x2019;d gone to school with since preschool. I had often wondered if some of them even knew my name. They never spoke to me. Hardly acknowledged me.<br> <br>I had blamed them for so long. However, over the summer I&#x2019;d come to realize a lot of things. One being I was the one who tried to be invisible. I was shy. I didn&#x2019;t want attention drawn to me. Often when I did get attention it was hurtful, and I kept to the shadows as much as possible. So if they didn&#x2019;t know my name, then it was because I had done nothing notable. Nothing to look back on one day and be proud of.<br> <br>This year would be different. I wasn&#x2019;t hiding now. I was tired of being the butt of everyone&#x2019;s jokes. I would make my senior year one to remember. One to be proud of. I was even going to join . . . something. Maybe the yearbook staff or possibly try out for the dance team. I could dance. That was my little secret. When I had weighed more than society thought I should, I hadn&#x2019;t wanted to dance in front of anyone. It was something I did alone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, new girl!&#x201d; a male voice called out. Since I wasn&#x2019;t new, I ignored him. But I did glance slightly to the left to see who it was. Asa Griffith. I almost paused. He was good friends with Ryker and Nash Lee. Ryker I didn&#x2019;t care about, but Nash . . . let&#x2019;s just say that my hurt and anger because of him were what kept me going all summer. When it was so hot I thought I&#x2019;d melt, but I walked anyway. When I really wanted some hot-from-the-oven cookies, but I ate an apple instead. It had been revenge. Admitting it wasn&#x2019;t something that I was proud of, but it was the truth. I hated Nash Lee. But that hate had driven me to lose weight.<br> <br>Before I could think too long and hard about it, I stopped and turned to Asa Griffith. He was attractive, popular, and would be the Lawton Lions star running back now that West Ashby had graduated. Asa gave me a flirty grin I had never seen before. Guys like Asa didn&#x2019;t smile at girls like me. Or they hadn&#x2019;t. I realized how shallow they were now that I was thin. My plan for revenge may be something ugly. But so was the way they treated girls due to their weight. Inside I was the same. No, that wasn&#x2019;t true; inside I was angrier now.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know how to flirt. I was one to shrink near a corner. So I just stared at him. Waiting to see what would come out of his mouth next.<br> <br>&#x201c;Asa,&#x201d; he said with a nod as he closed the distance between us. &#x201c;You just move here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I replied. This question I had prepared for. I was going to enjoy it. Seeing the looks on their faces when they found out they&#x2019;d known me for years.<br> <br>He was still smiling, but he looked confused. &#x201c;Homeschooled?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, Asa. We had Literature together last year. Economics the year before that. In fifth grade you tripped me in the hallway, and my books went everywhere. It was an accident. At least I assumed it was since you helped me pick up my books.&#x201d;<br> <br>That was more fun than I realized it would be. He stood there frowning. I wondered if he even knew my name. It only fueled the fire inside me. My revenge seemed justified.<br> <br>&#x201c;Asa,&#x201d; a familiar voice called out, then a pause. I turned my head and met his gaze head on. He wasn&#x2019;t the one I hated. He had never noticed me before. He&#x2019;d not been someone I expected to be better than that. Nash had been. But Ryker Lee had been there. He had said the words. Made the joke. The one that had cut deep enough to change me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, hello,&#x201d; Ryker Lee said with a drawl. Then as he got closer to me, I saw the confusion in his eyes. Slowly that turned to clarity. He recognized me. &#x201c;Holy shit,&#x201d; he muttered.<br> <br>I let him take in my transformation. As he let out a low whistle that I found insulting, Asa said &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; He was still confused.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tallulah, right?&#x201d; Ryker said when his eyes stopped gawking at my body and found my face.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow&#x201d; was all he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tallulah.&#x201d; Asa said my name as if it were familiar, but he just couldn&#x2019;t place it.<br> <br>&#x201c;The summer was good to you,&#x201d; Ryker finally said, a slow smile spreading across his face.<br> <br>I wanted to say that I had in fact worn a bathing suit. But I held that close. He didn&#x2019;t need to know I&#x2019;d heard him. I also didn&#x2019;t want to hear his apologies.<br> <br>&#x201c;Likewise,&#x201d; I said, although I gave him a forced smile. &#x201c;Have a good day,&#x201d; I added, then walked away. That was done. My first conversation with those close to Nash. As much as I didn&#x2019;t want to talk to them. Ryker had never spoken to me before. Why should I speak to him now? But I had to. My plan was to be accepted into Nash&#x2019;s world and then completely ignore him. Embarrass him in front of his friends. Let him see how it felt. Then, when I was satisfied, I&#x2019;d walk away from all of that crowd. Find a path that fit me and be happy. But not yet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; Asa called out.<br> <br>I stopped walking and glanced back at him. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a senior, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>It was all I could do not to roll my eyes. I simply nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your first class?&#x201d;<br> <br>Seriously? It was this easy? He didn&#x2019;t know me. Had no idea if I was intelligent, had a sense of humor, had any ambition in life. But he saw how I looked in this short skirt, and that was all it took. I had his complete attention.<br> <br>&#x201c;Trig,&#x201d; I told him.<br> <br>His eyebrows shot up. &#x201c;Gorgeous and smart. We&#x2019;ve got that one together. I&#x2019;ll walk with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>We had been in advanced classes together since ninth grade. Something he didn&#x2019;t recall. But I did.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I agreed, then saw Ryker watching me. I gave him a smile and little wave that I assumed was flirty before walking toward the entrance with Asa.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m having a hard time believing we&#x2019;ve been in school together since elementary and I don&#x2019;t remember you. Although your name is familiar.&#x201d;<br> <br>For a smart boy, you&#x2019;d think he would realize how admitting he didn&#x2019;t remember me made him seem like a jerk.<br> <br>&#x201c;I doubt you notice fat girls.&#x201d; The distaste in my tone was unavoidable. I could only take so much.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fat?&#x201d; he repeated. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not fat.&#x201d;<br> <br>I turned my head until my eyes met his. &#x201c;No, Asa, not now. Not anymore. But the Tallulah you don&#x2019;t remember was fat.&#x201d;<br> <br>Slowly I could see the recognition in his eyes. They grew wider, and then his mouth dropped open slightly. Maybe he did remember the fat girl in the corner. My face was thin now, but it had all the same features. If he&#x2019;d ever taken the time to look at me then, he&#x2019;d see that.<br> <br>&#x201c;You gave me your notes last year when I missed class for a week with the flu,&#x201d; he whispered. Like he was too amazed to talk in his normal tone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>He stared at me then. I wondered how many other memories of me he was recalling. I let him stare. Remember the girl I once was, because that girl was nicer. Kinder. This one wasn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>This Tallulah was going to leave her mark, then walk away.</p><h2>Raising Animals for Fiber: Producing Wool from Sheep, Goats, Alpacas, and Rabbits in Your Backyard (CompanionHouse Books) Livestock Health, Grooming, Housing, Breeding, &amp; Shearing, from Angora to Suri</h2><p>Fiber Animals for the Backyard and Hobby Farm Raising backyard fiber animals is rising in popularity, as more and more people seek traditional textiles for yarn-focused crafts like knitting, crocheting, and weaving, as well as spinning, embroidery, needlepoint, needle felting, wet felting, and fiber dying.

PB.)</p><p>St. Alphonsus Liguori was born in 1696 to Neapolitan nobility at Marianella, Italy. He became a recognizable lawyer after going through law school at the age of sixteen, but later decided to leave law in favor of giving his salvation more attention. Alphonsus joined the Oratory of St. Philip Neri as a seminarian and was ordained in 1726, when he was thirty. The homilies he gave had the special ability of converting those who had fallen away from the faith. He also founded the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, and authored such works as <i>The Glories of Mary</i>, <i>The True Spouse of Jesus Christ</i>, <i>Attaining Salvation</i>, <i>The Blessed Virgin Mary</i>, <i>Preparation for Death Abridged</i>, <i>What Will Hell Be Like?</i>, <i>The Twelve Steps to Holiness and Salvation</i>, and <i>The Way of the Cross</i>.<br><br> After being a bishop for over a decade, St. Alphonsus Liguori died on the first of August, 1787. He was canonized by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839, and declared a Doctor of the Church in 1871. His feast is celebrated on August 1.</p><h2>Southern Living A Southern Gentleman&#39;s Kitchen: Adventures in Cooking, Eating, and Living in the New South</h2><p>Today, in addition to being chivalrous, honest, and generous, a Southern gentleman is socially connected, well-traveled, and has an appetite for life.

After dying a grisly death in WAR OF THE REALMS, the reborn Trickster learned a valuable lesson in warmongering: Don't get caught. But now Loki has a whole new set of responsibilities - and his brother Thor isn't about to let him walk away from them. Restless with his new duties, Loki seeks out the advice of the closest thing Midgard has to a king - Tony Stark, the Invincible Iron Man! Close enough, right? But it turns out that Shell-head isn't too happy to see Loki, on account of all that stuff he did in the past.

Minimalism and Pop art, abstraction and conceptualism coincide in her practice, which spans painting, sculpture, performance, room-sized and outdoor installation, the written word, films, fashion, design, and architectural interventions. Born in 1929 in Matsumoto, Japan, Yayoi Kusama briefly studied painting in Kyoto before moving to New York City in the late 1950s. In the mid-1960s, she established herself in New York as an important avant-garde artist by staging groundbreaking happenings, events, and exhibitions. Now in her late 80s, Kusama is entering one of the richest creative periods of her life. Immersed in her studio six days a week, Kusama has spoken of her renewed dedication to creating art over the past years: &#x201c;[N]ew ideas come welling up every day....Now I am more keenly aware of the time that remains and more in awe of the vast scope of art.&#x201d; Yayoi Kusama: Give Me Love documents the artist's most recent exhibition at David Zwirner, New York, which marked the US debut of The Obliteration Room, an all-white, domestic interior that viewers are invited to cover with dot stickers of various sizes and colors. Taking The Obliteration Room as its centerpiece, this catalogue reveals, in vivid large-scale plates, the transformation of the space from a clean white interior to a stunningly saturated room, with ceilings, walls, and furniture covered in myriad multicolored stickers put there by viewers over the course of the exhibition. The catalogue also includes beautiful reproductions of Kusama's new large-format paintings from My Eternal Soul series. Ranging from bright and densely pixelated forms, to umber figures with darker blues and muted oranges, these paintings demonstrate the artist's striking command of color, and her exceptional control over balance and contrast. Bold brushstrokes hover between figuration and abstraction; vibrant, animated, and intense, these paintings introduce their own powerful pictorial logic, at once contemporary and universal. The catalogue continues with a selection of new, large Pumpkin sculptures, a form that Kusama has been exploring since her studies in Japan in the 1950s, and which gained prominence in the 1980s, continuing to remain an essential part of her practice. Made of shiny stainless steel and featuring painted dots or dot-shaped perforations that recall The Obliteration Room, these immersive works seem created on human scale, with the tallest measuring 70 inches (178 cm). Vibrant plates capture how color, shape, size, and surface merge in these sculptures and mesmerize the viewer. Texts include a "Hymn to Yayoi Kusama" by art critic and poet Akira Tatehata and a poem by the artist herself.</p><p>Yayoi Kusama&#x2019;s work has transcended two of the most important art movements of the second half of the twentieth century: pop art and minimalism. Her extraordinary and highly influential career spans paintings, performances, room-size presentations, outdoor sculptural installations, literary works, films, fashion, design, and interventions within existing architectural structures, which allude at once to microscopic and macroscopic universes.Endlessly complex.

However, much has changed in the world and the Church. Leaders have discovered new ways to implement the <em>Five Practices </em>in settings that were not imagined when the original book was released. This revised and updated edition of the ministry leadership classic includes a significant amount of new material.<br> <br> How are the Practices being used now, in new types of congregations? How has each Practice changed in the last decade? What new issues or concerns do leaders need to consider in relation to each Practice?&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>This revision provides leaders with a 'next step' look at the original practices. Schnase gathered ideas and other content from ministry leaders who have been using the Five Practices, and explains how those ideas work, how leaders adapted the principles to their own settings, and how they expanded them.</li> <li>A new preface redefines 'Congregations' given their evolving nature. When the original book was written, the new forms of Christian community either did not exist or were barely known. The Five Practices are, however, just as essential to the new types of congregations as they were to the traditional church.</li> <li>Since the original book, there is more variety, diversity, and experimentation in worship. The revised Five Practices includes material based on these new forms.</li> <li>Small group study has always been important for intentional faith development. But since the original book, the nature of those groups has transformed to include secular settings and a wide variety of affinities profoundly affecting how faith leaders approach issues of faith development, and in many cases radically changes what they offer in their communities.</li> <li>Imagine the topic of Risk-Taking Mission and Service before Black Lives Matter, the Syrian refugee crisis, and the Trump administration. This new version gives instruction and specific ideas for how we might best serve today&#x2019;s world.</li> </ul></p><p>Robert Schnase is bishop of the Rio Texas Conference of The United Methodist Church.

According to the author, the difference between a good idea and a prosperous business is a well-written business plan. At its most basic level, a business plan helps organize an entrepreneur&#x2019;s thoughts, Sutton writes; at its highest level, it provides a tightly structured outline of what the business will accomplish, how it will be funded and its requirements for long-term success. Sutton provides advice on how to establish a vision for what the business will do, how to gauge the potential company&#x2019;s competition and how to find funding. Ideally, a business plan is the intersection of everything inside the business (costs, products, services, personnel, etc.) and everything outside the business (competition, market trends, political forces, etc.).&#x201d; The book provides several examples of how structured plans have helped individuals understand their opportunities and challenges and, as an example, also supplies a detailed plan of a potential restaurant. The author writes with authority, giving concrete reasons behind each section of a plan, but offers plenty of encouragement along the way, motivating readers to undertake what is essentially a soul-searching exercise as well as a financial one. Sutton is also objective and truthful when highlighting the pitfalls that entrepreneurs may encounter.

The rhyming verse and illustration pair to make clear to readers the job of each train: the monorail's heavy-lidded eyes look toward the airport it services, and the subway rests under a brightly lit and busy city street reminiscent of Times Square. Trains include steam, passenger, freight, fire, high-speed, and breakdown trains as well as trolleys, and the ending suitably places most around a roundhouse under their blanket of stars...before a turn of the page reveals a boy and a girl asleep in their twin beds, their toy trains and tracks laid out in an otherwise pristine bedroom. Pair this with Kevin Lewis' Chugga-chugga Choo-choo, illustrated by Daniel Kirk (1999), for more train fun. Thanks to the popularity of Thomas the Tank Engine, <b>hopeful engineers will want to be able to identify the many different types of trains, and their out-of-the-know adults will appreciate this inclusive primer</b>. &#x2014;&#x2014;<b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></p><h2>All the Impossible Things</h2><p><p><b>A bit of magic, a sprinkling of adventure, and a whole lot of heart collide in <i>All the Impossible Things</i>, Lindsay Lackey's extraordinary middle-grade novel about a young girl navigating the foster care system in search of where she belongs.</b></p><p><b>"Wise and wondrous, this is truly a novel to cherish.&#x201d; &#x2015;Katherine Applegate, <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author of <i>Wishtree</i></b><br><b></b><br><b>An Indies Introduce Selection</b></p><p>Red&#x2019;s inexplicable power over the wind comes from her mother.

As Little Wolf trudges home from school one day, he decides to postpone his boring dinner by shouting "Boy! Boy!" But what will happen when a real boy finally comes along? In this hilarious twisted tale, Little Wolf learns the same timeless lesson that the boy who cried "Wolf!" did so many years ago.</p><p>Bob Hartman lives in England.<br>Tim Raglin lives in Independence, Kansas.*Starred Review* Reviewed with Gail Carson Levine's <i>Betsy Who Cried Wolf!</i> <p>PreS.-Gr. 2. Two funny turns on a familiar tale: Hartman's twists species; Levine's twists gender. </p><p>In <i>The Wolf Who Cried Boy</i>, Little Wolf wishes for something besides lamburgers and sloppy does for dinner. Actually, he'd prefer boy. Father agrees that if Little Wolf finds one, he can eat it. So the next day, to avoid another boring dinner, Little Wolf screams, "Boy!" His parents run, sniff, and search, but don't find a boy. Little Wolf thinks that's so funny, he pulls the same trick again, and his parents catch on. When Little Wolf sees a troop of boy scouts, he can't believe his eyes. Of course, his parents don't believe him--even when a scout makes himself at home on the wolves' couch. Unlike fractured fairy tales that rely simply on premise, this one finds humor in the details, in both the story (Granny Smith pie featuring a "hard, crusty" granny) and the art (the mischievous scout, emboldened by the wolves' disbelief). Raglin's sturdy pen-and-ink pictures, which soar above their cartoon styling, are electric with fun. </p><p>In <i>Betsy, </i> the illustrations are also more than simply amusing. Nash uses balloon captions for his sheep to express their thoughts about Betsy, the new eight-year-old shepherd. Betsy is determined to be the best shepherd ever, but Zimmo the wolf has another plan. Betsy spots Zimmo, who has all the characteristics on the wolf checklist, but he disappears when the grown-ups show up to check him out. The next time that happens, Betsy is sent back to shepherd school. The third time, Betsy deals with him herself and makes him a friend with her shepherd pies. The pacing slows a bit at the end, but there are some laugh-aloud moments and children will identify with the feisty, young shepherd. There's a glow and a flow to the pictures that add shine to the story. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Then Frankie learns that Matthew is a member of the Loyal Order&nbsp;of the Basset Hounds, an all-male Alabaster secret society to which Frankie&#x2019;s dad had once belonged. Excluded from belonging to or even discussing the Bassets, Frankie engineers&nbsp;her own&nbsp;guerilla membership by assuming a false online identity. Frankie is a fan of P. G. Wodehouse&#x2019;s&nbsp;books,&nbsp;and Lockhart&#x2019;s wholly engaging narrative, filled with wordplay, often reads like a clever satire about the capers&nbsp;of the entitled, interwoven with elements of a mystery. But the story&#x2019;s expertly timed comedy also has deep undercurrents. Lockhart creates a unique, indelible character in Frankie, whose oddities only make her more realistic, and teens will be galvanized by her brazen action and her passionate, immediate questions about gender and power, individuals and institutions, and how to fall in love without losing herself.

This picture book is full of surprises, both in the simple text and in the dramatic underlying story the pictures tell. On one level, it's a celebration of a glorious villain; like all pirates, tough Boris is massive and scruffy and greedy and fearless and scary. Brown's bold watercolor paintings show him in all his hideous glory, huge bristles sticking out of his chin, anger in his eyes, cutlass in his hand, as he handles his motley crew. But when his parrot dies, "he cried and cried. All pirates cry." As you go back over the pictures, you notice that his cheeky green parrot has always been with Boris, usually on his shoulder or perched on a finger. You also notice another whole story, not mentioned in the text. A small barefoot boy with a violin case stows away on the pirate ship. Tough Boris makes the boy play his instrument, and all the fierce crew members stand still and listen. When Boris' parrot dies, the boy and the pirate grieve together, their shoulders bowed. The boy also cries at the end when the pirate ship brings him back home and leaves him with his violin and bow alone on the shore. Unfortunately, the design is confusing; the boy appears on the imprint page but then remains hidden until the middle of the book; some kids may be puzzled about where he comes from. However, for those who look carefully, the wordless story is a poignant counterpoint to the swashbuckling adventure scenes. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Cam Jansen: the Mystery of the Gold Coins #5</h2><p>The Cam Jansen books are perfect for young readers who are making the transition to chapter books, and Cam is a spunky young heroine whom readers have loved for over two decades.

Before writing his first novel, Crais spent several years writing scripts for such major television series as&nbsp;<i>Hill Street Blues</i>,&nbsp;<i>Cagney &amp; Lacey</i>,&nbsp;<i>Miami Vice</i>,&nbsp;<i>Quincy</i>,&nbsp;<i>Baretta</i>, and<i>&nbsp;L.A. Law</i>. He received an Emmy nomination for his work on&nbsp;<i>Hill Street Blues</i>, and one of his standalone novels,&nbsp;<i>Hostage</i>, was made into a movie starring Bruce Willis. His novels have been translated into forty-two languages and are bestsellers around the world. A native of Louisiana, he lives in Los Angeles.<p>1</p><p>Elvis Cole</p><p>James Tyson Connor walked out of his home on a chill fall morning, climbed into a twelve-year-old Volvo, and left for school an hour late. Tyson was a seventeen-year-old junior at an alternative school in the San Fernando Valley. He was thin, nervous, and cursed with soft features and gentle eyes that made him look like a freshman. Nothing about him suggested that Tyson was one of the most wanted felons in Los Angeles.</p><p>Tyson and his mother lived in a modest, one-story ranch house not far from his school. I was a block away, waiting for Tyson to leave. His mother had warned me he would be late. Tyson suffered from anxiety issues, and hated going to school. Two prior schools had expelled him for absenteeism and failing grades, so his mother enrolled him at the alternative school to keep him from dropping out. This was a decision she regretted.</p><p>His mother called as Tyson drove away.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Cole? Are you here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been here almost two hours, Ms. Connor. The sunrise was lovely.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s gone. You can come in now.&#x201d;</p><p>Tyson&#x2019;s mother worked as an office manager for a law firm in Encino. She appeared neat, trim, and ready for work when she opened the door, but carried herself with so much tension she might have been wrapped with duct tape.</p><p>I walked up the drive, and offered my hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Elvis Cole.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Devon Connor. Thanks so much for coming, Mr. Cole. I&#x2019;m sorry he took so long.&#x201d;</p><p>I stepped into her living room, and watched her lock the door. The house smelled of pancakes and fish, and something I didn&#x2019;t place. A glowing aquarium bubbled beside a couch.</p><p>&#x201c;The new school doesn&#x2019;t mind, him being so late?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;With what they charge, they should send a limo.&#x201d;</p><p>She stopped herself, and closed her eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry. I sound like a bitch.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s your son. You&#x2019;re worried.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Beyond worried. I moved mountains to get him into this school, and now I feel like I&#x2019;ve fed him to animals.&#x201d;</p><p>Devon had found money and valuables in Tyson&#x2019;s room. She believed&nbsp;her son had gotten involved with drug dealers and gangsters, and wanted me to find out what he was doing. I wasn&#x2019;t sure I wanted the job.</p><p>I tried to sound reassuring.</p><p>&#x201c;It probably isn&#x2019;t as bad as you think, Ms. Connor. These things usually aren&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>She studied me like I was stupid, and abruptly turned away.</p><p>&#x201c;Follow me. I&#x2019;ll show you how bad.&#x201d;</p><p>Tyson&#x2019;s bedroom was small, and looked like a typical middle-class, teenage boy&#x2019;s bedroom. A dresser sat opposite a walk-in closet, an �unmade bed filled the corner, and his nightstand bristled with soda cans, chip bags, and crumbs. Special Forces operators with glowing green eyes watched us&nbsp;from a recruitment poster above the bed. A desk beneath his window was crowded with a desktop computer, a laptop, three monitors, and an impressive tangle of game controllers.</p><p>I said, &#x201c;He must be a serious gamer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He can&#x2019;t sit still in school, but he can sit in front of these things for hours.&#x201d;</p><p>She went to the desk, opened the middle side drawer, and took something from the back of it.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>This&nbsp;</i>is how bad it is.&#x201d;</p><p>She held out a watch with a bright white face, three dials, and three knobs on the rim. The distinctive Rolex crown was obvious.</p><p>&#x201c;A Rolex?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A Rolex Cosmograph Daytona, made with eighteen-carat white gold. A watch like this sells for forty thousand dollars, new. Even used, they sell for more than twenty. He came home wearing it. I said, this is a Rolex, where&#x2019;d you get a watch like this?&#x201d;</p><p>Small nicks marred the rim and crystal, but the watch appeared otherwise perfect.</p><p>&#x201c;What did he say?&#x201d;</p><p>She rolled her eyes, and looked disgusted.</p><p>&#x201c;A flea market, can you imagine? He says it&#x2019;s a knockoff, but I don&#x2019;t believe it. Does this look like a knockoff to you?&#x201d;</p><p>She pushed the watch closer, so I took it. The body felt heavy and substantial. The hands showed the correct time, and the second hand swept the face with silent precision, but I wasn&#x2019;t an expert.</p><p>&#x201c;Could it be a gift, and he doesn&#x2019;t want you to know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who would give him a gift like this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;His father? A grandparent?&#x201d;</p><p>She frowned again, and gave me the &#x2018;you&#x2019;re stupid&#x2019; eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;His father left before Tyson was born, and everyone else is dead. My son should not have this watch. He shouldn&#x2019;t have&nbsp;<i>anything</i>&nbsp;this expensive, and we have to stop him before he gets himself killed or arrested.&#x201d;</p><p>We.</p><p>I tried to tone down the drama.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe we&#x2019;re getting ahead of ourselves. If the watch is real, then he shouldn&#x2019;t have it, but this is the kind of thing a kid might lift if he saw it at a friend&#x2019;s house. You don&#x2019;t need a detective if Tyson has sticky fingers.&#x201d;</p><p>The reasonable detective offered a reasonable explanation, but she seemed disappointed.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s so much more than the watch.&#x201d;</p><p>She went to the closet, and reached inside.</p><p>&#x201c;It started with shirts. He didn&#x2019;t even bother to hide them, like with the watch.&#x201d;</p><p>I said, &#x201c;Shirts.&#x201d;</p><p>She came out with a sleek black sport coat trimmed with velvet lapels.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>New</i>&nbsp;shirts. Then new shoes turned up, and another new shirt, and this jacket, all from Barneys in Beverly Hills. We can&#x2019;t afford Barneys.&#x201d;</p><p>Her phone chirped with an incoming text. She checked the message, and slipped the phone back into her pocket.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry. The school. I text when he leaves, they text when he arrives. It&#x2019;s how we keep track.&#x201d;</p><p>Alternative.</p><p>I fingered the jacket. The fabric felt soft and creamy, like very fine wool. Expensive.</p><p>I glanced up, and found her watching me. Waiting.</p><p>&#x201c;Did the clothes come from the same flea market?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, this time a friend&#x2019;s father runs the wardrobe department at a studio. They get so many free clothes, Tyson can have whatever he wants.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t say anything. Devon went on without my prompting.</p><p>&#x201c;I called Barneys. This jacket? Tyson bought it. The salesman remembered because Tyson paid cash. Three thousand dollars, and Tyson paid&nbsp;<i>cash</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>She put the jacket back in the closet, and went to his bed.</p><p>&#x201c;After I found out about Barneys, I searched his room.&#x201d;</p><p>She slid a plastic storage container from under the bed. The container was filled with keyboards, Game Boy and Xbox gear, and action figures. She moved a keyboard, took out a box, and opened it. The box contained a thick roll of cash wrapped by a blue rubber band.</p><p>&#x201c;Four thousand, two hundred dollars. I counted. The first time, he had twenty-three hundred dollars. I found over seven thousand dollars here once. The amount changes.&#x201d;</p><p>I sat back and stared at her. Devon was describing an income stream.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you ask him about the money?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If I ask, he&#x2019;ll lie, just like he lied about the clothes and the watch. I want to know what he&#x2019;s doing and who he&#x2019;s doing it with before I confront him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can ask him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If we ask, he&#x2019;ll know I snoop, and he&#x2019;ll still lie. Don&#x2019;t detectives follow people? You could follow him and see what he does.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Following someone is expensive. Asking is cheaper.&#x201d;</p><p>Her mouth pinched, and she glanced away. Worried.</p><p>&#x201c;We should discuss your fee. I have a good job, but I&#x2019;m not wealthy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. What would you like to know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How much would it cost to follow him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two cars minimum, one op per car, ready to go twenty-four/seven. Call it three thousand a day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;</p><p>She wet her lips, and her eyes lost focus. She was trying to figure out how to come up with the money, and all her options were bad. I had met a hundred parents like Devon, and seen the same fearful confusion in their eyes. Like people who didn&#x2019;t know how to swim, watching their children drown.</p><p>I changed the subject.</p><p>&#x201c;How long has this been going on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Since the beginning of school.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And whatever he&#x2019;s doing, you believe he&#x2019;s doing it with students from school.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes snapped into hard focus.</p><p>&#x201c;Tyson&#x2019;s never been in trouble. Tyson&#x2019;s a sweetheart! He stayed home all the time, he never went out, he was afraid of everything, but then he started changing. He met a girl.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was thrilled. Tyson doesn&#x2019;t meet girls. Tyson&#x2019;s afraid of girls.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have you met her?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He wouldn&#x2019;t tell me her name. He made friends with a boy named Alec. They go to the mall. I ask questions, but he&#x2019;s evasive and vague, or&nbsp;makes up more lies. Tyson was never like this. He never used to go to the mall, and now he&#x2019;s never home.&#x201d;</p><p>Tyson sounded like any other teenage boy, except for the parts about money and watches.</p><p>&#x201c;He met Alec at school?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think so, but I checked the roster.&#x201d;</p><p>She took a slim red booklet from Tyson&#x2019;s desk. The cover was emblazoned with a soaring bird and the name of the school. Cal-Matrix Alternative Education.&nbsp;<i>Where students soar.</i></p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t find anyone named Alec or Alexander.&#x201d;</p><p>We weren&#x2019;t exactly drowning in clues.</p><p>I jiggled the watch. An authentic Rolex had serial and model numbers cut into the head behind the bracelet, or on the inner rim below the crystal. High-end fakes often had numbers, too, but fake numbers didn&#x2019;t appear in the manufacturer&#x2019;s records.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell you what. I have a friend who knows watches. She can tell us if the watch is real. She might even be able to tell us who owns it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t take it. Tyson might notice.&#x201d;</p><p>I told her about the numbers.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take off the bracelet, and copy the numbers. The watch can stay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t have to follow him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll start small to keep the costs down, and see what develops. Sound good?&#x201d;</p><p>Her face brightened, and split with a smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Perfect.&#x201d;</p><p>I thought about the money and the watch she&#x2019;d found, and wondered if Tyson had hidden anything else.</p><p>&#x201c;You searched his room, but what about his car?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Only twice. When the car&#x2019;s home, he&#x2019;s home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you have a spare key, I&#x2019;d like it. I&#x2019;ll check his car after I call in the watch.&#x201d;</p><p>She started away for the key, then hesitated.</p><p>&#x201c;I saw on your website, The Elvis Cole Detective Agency. The website&nbsp;says your work is confidential.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Meaning, when we find out what Tyson&#x2019;s doing, you won&#x2019;t tell the police?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It depends.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The website doesn&#x2019;t say anything about depends.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If I find a human head in his trunk, I might feel the urge to report it.&#x201d;</p><p>She smiled again, and turned away.</p><p>&#x201c;No human heads, Mr. Cole. Not yet.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t like the way she said &#x2018;yet.&#x2019;</p><p>Devon gave me the key and watched me copy the numbers. When the bracelet was back on the watch, she put the watch in the drawer, and we left the house together.</p><p>Devon Connor drove away first. She had a long drive in bad traffic ahead, and was already late for work. Alternative schools were expensive, and so were detectives.</p><p>I started my car, but I didn&#x2019;t leave. I pictured the skinny kid with gentle eyes who looked like a freshman. I pictured him sneaking cash into his room, and hiding it under his bed. There were many ways he could have gotten the cash, but none of the ways were good.</p><p>Devon&#x2019;s pleasant, middle-class street was peaceful. No one was trying to murder her, or Tyson, or me, but this was about to change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sherri Toyoda and&nbsp;her family&nbsp;owned a watch shop in Santa Monica. The Toyodas sold moderately priced timepieces almost anyone could afford, but their restoration of antique and vintage collectibles had made them legends. Photographs of Sherri&#x2019;s parents with dignitaries, �politicians, and movie stars covered the walls. Three U.S. presidents, eleven senators, and four Supreme Court justices were among their clients.</p><p>I checked the numbers from the watch, and called her.</p><p>&#x201c;Guess who?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yesterday&#x2019;s bad news?&#x201d;</p><p>Sherri and I used to date.</p><p>&#x201c;I need help with a Rolex.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll help if I can, but we&#x2019;re not an authorized dealer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not shopping. This is a specific Cosmograph Daytona.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sweet! If you can afford a Cosmo, I might date you again.&#x201d;</p><p>Everyone thinks they&#x2019;re a riot.</p><p>&#x201c;I need to know if it&#x2019;s genuine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bring it in. I can tell if it&#x2019;s real in five seconds.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have the watch. I have the serial and model numbers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have the chronometer certification that came with it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If I knew what a chronometer certification was, the answer would be no. All I have are the numbers.&#x201d;</p><p>She was silent for a moment.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, listen. I can check your numbers with a friend at the corporate office. If your numbers match his numbers, the watch is authentic.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Great.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not so great if it&#x2019;s stolen. He&#x2019;ll want to know how I have the numbers, and why I&#x2019;m asking. Is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Could be. How would he know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dude. You buy a watch like this, you&#x2019;re walking around with twenty or thirty thousand dollars on your wrist. Guess what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They get stolen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or lost, so the company keeps a list of AWOL watches for their clients. If you lose your watch, you give them the numbers. If your watch turns up, they know you&#x2019;re the rightful owner, and give you a shout.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Meaning, you could find out who owns it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not necessarily. People sell watches. They give them as gifts. The company doesn&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you trying to find the owner?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;</p><p>She thought some more.</p><p>&#x201c;I still might be able to help. Stores activate the warranty when someone buys a watch like this. The original buyer might be in the warranty files. Want me to check?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the best, Sherri. Thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>I read off the numbers, and lowered my phone, but I still didn&#x2019;t leave. Devon had searched Tyson&#x2019;s room, but she was his mom, and almost certainly missed something. I was a trained professional, and knew where to look. Or maybe I&#x2019;d get lucky.</p><p>I turned off my car, and walked up Devon&#x2019;s drive for the second time that morning. The side gate squealed, I passed Tyson&#x2019;s window, and let myself in through the kitchen.</p><p>The Connor residence held three bedrooms and two baths. Tyson probably wouldn&#x2019;t hide something in his mother&#x2019;s bedroom or bath, so I skipped them, and started in Tyson&#x2019;s bathroom.</p><p>Green streaks of toothpaste highlighted the sink, and the counter was forested with deodorant, mouthwash, zit cream, and all the usual bathroom items. A frazzled toothbrush and disposable razor stood sentry in a plastic X-Men cup. Tyson&#x2019;s medications were lined up beneath the mirror. The scripts bore Tyson&#x2019;s name, and were written for medicines commonly used to treat depression, anxiety, and attention deficit disorder. I found nothing out of the ordinary in the cabinets, behind the towels, or in the toilet tank.</p><p>The third bedroom was set up as an office, but Devon used it as a catch-all room. Mirrored sliders filled a wall opposite a desk, a file cabinet, and a bookcase jammed with law books, paperback thrillers, and titles like&nbsp;<i>The Unhappy Child</i>,&nbsp;<i>Coping with Fear</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Single Mother&#x2019;s Rule Book</i>. Cardboard boxes of Christmas decorations were stacked on a treadmill between the desk and a window, and the desk was heavy with bills, unread magazines, and a file devoted to Tyson&#x2019;s school. The file contained promotional brochures, articles, and another copy of the roster. I took a brochure and the roster, and moved on to Tyson&#x2019;s room.</p></p><h2>Tales from the Dallas Cowboys Sideline: A Collection of the Greatest Cowboys Stories Ever Told (Tales from the Team)</h2><p><i>Tales from the Dallas Cowboys Sideline</i>, first published in 2003 and now newly updated, is a fascinating, fun look at the inner workings of one of the most beloved sports teams of all time.

So when charming Zac Ridgemont sweeps her off her feet, Didi believes she might finally have met the one.<br> <br>Until she begins an internship at a military hospital in California.

My first day isn&#x2019;t going so well. I&#x2019;ve already had to run the gauntlet of a dozen half-dressed marines catcalling me when I walked through the wrong door and into the male locker rooms. That sounds like a porn fantasy, and normally Jessa and I would fall about laughing at something like that happening, but in reality it wasn&#x2019;t in the least bit funny.<br> <br>I knew that it was going to be a tough assignment and that being the boss&#x2019;s daughter wasn&#x2019;t going to buy me any favors, but . . . I wasn&#x2019;t expecting this either.<br> <br>Just then an alarm sounds, startling me. Jos� takes off. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back in a minute. Don&#x2019;t move,&#x201d; he yells over his shoulder.<br> <br>I stand there in the middle of the hallway, staring at the posters on the walls of marines in triumphant poses with words like &#x201c;Inspire,&#x201d; &#x201c;Overcome,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Thrive&#x201d; boldly printed across them. The center is new and shiny and full of platitudes like this. Personally I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;d want to see a picture of a grinning marine running to victory if I&#x2019;d just had my leg shot off, but I&#x2019;m not an interior decorator, only a trainee psychologist.<br> <br>Everything is state of the art (apart from the art, it would seem), including the swimming pool that&#x2019;s used for therapy. Currently two hundred wounded marines and other army personnel are being treated at the center for a range of issues, from physical injuries right through to mental illness.<br> <br>This is the first day of my summer internship and I&#x2019;m being given a tour. The pool was the first stop, the locker room the second. I saw more in those few startled seconds than I think a tour of the entire facilities will give me&#x2014;an array of limbless bodies, men missing legs and arms. But clearly not their sense of humor. My cheeks are still burning at some of the comments and suggestions made by the guys back in the changing room.<br> <br>&#x201c;Damn it!&#x201d; someone yells, making me jump.<br> <br>I scan the corridor. The cursing came from the room on my right.<br> <br>&#x201c;Damn!&#x201d;<br> <br>I inch toward the door and peer around it. There&#x2019;s a guy on the bed with a bandage wrapped around his eyes. One arm is in a sling. A tray of food sits on the table in front of him and he&#x2019;s struggling with one arm and no sight to open what looks like a carton of yogurt. Frustration seems to be getting the better of him.<br> <br>I take a step inside the room. He reaches for a spoon, fumbling on the tray and knocking off a dish that clatters to the ground, spraying cereal all over the floor and his sheets.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here&#x2014;&#x201d; I start to say, but he lets out a roar, stabs the spoon through the lid of the carton, and next thing I know I&#x2019;m splattered head to foot in a cold shower of strawberry yogurt.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I say, feeling it drip from my hair onto my blouse.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201d; he growls, raising his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um,&#x201d; I say, blinking yogurt out of my eyes. &#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Didi. Didi Monroe.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; he snaps.<br> <br>&#x201c;Getting a yogurt facial, it would seem,&#x201d; I mumble, wiping my face with the back of my arm. Great, I just blow-dried my hair. I&#x2019;m going to need to go and take a shower now and find some new clothes to wear.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you a nurse?&#x201d; the guy asks, scowling in my direction.<br> <br>I shake my head and then, realizing he can&#x2019;t see me, say, &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, what are you doing in here, then?&#x201d;<br> <br>I blink at him in astonishment. &#x201c;I heard you shouting. I came to see if I could help.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need your help. I don&#x2019;t need any help,&#x201d; he shouts. &#x201c;Just get out!&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;m speechless. Totally speechless. What an asshole. &#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I stammer. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll leave you to it. Enjoy your breakfast.&#x201d;<br> <br>I walk out into the corridor, cursing under my breath, still dripping yogurt. This day can&#x2019;t get any worse. And then I look up and see a poster of a gurgling baby with the words &#x201c;Laugh and the world laughs with you&#x201d; written across it in Comic Sans.<br> <br>Jos� jogs back along the corridor just then and, taking one look at me standing in a puddle of pink yogurt, his eyes widen. &#x201c;Oh shit,&#x201d; he says, trying not to laugh and failing. &#x201c;You met Grumpy, I take it.&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Half an hour later I exit the bathroom wearing a very unflattering pair of green scrubs that are one size too big. I spent a good ten minutes trying to style them into something that doesn&#x2019;t make me look like a swamp monster, and failed. The pants are so long I&#x2019;ve had to roll them up at the ankle, and the top is long in the arms but strains against my boobs. I&#x2019;ve put on lashings of lipstick, hoping to divert attention away from my chest, but I can tell by the look on Jos�&#x2019;s face that it isn&#x2019;t working. I may as well wave good-bye to my dignity for the day.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wearing the shit out of those scrubs,&#x201d; Jos� tells me, laughing. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to make a lot of wounded warriors very happy today.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shoot him a dark look, but the grin has now taken over his face and I find myself laughing too.<br> <br>Jos� is twenty-nine, an army medic who&#x2019;s already done three tours in Iraq and has now transferred to the center, where he&#x2019;s in charge of this ward. He&#x2019;s trained in physical therapy and he also seems to have been trained in positive mental attitude. Either that or he&#x2019;s been around all these posters for far too long. He&#x2019;s been given the dubious responsibility of showing me around.<br> <br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;you want to continue with the tour?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure there&#x2019;s some ritual humiliation I&#x2019;m missing out on. We&#x2019;d better hurry up and find it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jos� nods his head in the direction of the doors. &#x201c;Right, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d; He checks the time. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got half an hour before I take you to your first patient.&#x201d;<br> <br>I get a buzz in my stomach followed by a swirl of nausea when he says the word patient. I&#x2019;ve never had a patient before. I&#x2019;m not entirely sure I&#x2019;m ready to have patients. What if they see right through me? What if they figure out I have no clue what I&#x2019;m doing? No, I remind myself. I have a degree in psychology. I&#x2019;m studying for a doctorate. I&#x2019;m smart. I&#x2019;m capable. I can do this.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be nervous,&#x201d; Jos� says as he holds the door open for me. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re big teddy bears underneath.&#x201d; We pass Grumpy&#x2019;s room. Jos� hesitates. &#x201c;Well, most of them.&#x201d;<br> <br>I glance quickly inside. An orderly is clearing up the cereal on the floor while the guy in the bed with the bandages sits facing the window, his jaw pulsing angrily. Teddy bear wouldn&#x2019;t be the term I&#x2019;d use to describe that one. Grizzly bear, maybe.<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened to him?&#x201d; I whisper as soon as we&#x2019;re past the open door.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Walker,&#x201d; Jos� says, still walking. &#x201c;He was with Alpha team. Youngest lieutenant in the marines, I hear. Nearly everyone in his unit was killed in an ambush.&#x201d;<br> <br>I come to a standstill. &#x201c;Oh my God.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jos� glances back over his shoulder at me. &#x201c;Yeah, five men died. Only him and one other guy survived.&#x201d;<br> <br>Guilt sweeps over me that I thought he was an asshole.<br> <br>&#x201c;Welcome to the realities of war,&#x201d; Jos� says before striding off toward the elevator.</p><h2>The Summer House</h2><p><b>From this <i>USA Today </i>bestselling author comes </b><b>a delightful summer read about friendship, family, and the healing power of love.</b> <b><br></b> Callie Weaver and her best friend, Olivia Dixon, have finally done it: put their life savings into the beach house they admired through childhood summers, on the dazzling white sand of North Carolina's Outer Banks.

Tragically, theologians have often either set the two at odds or focused on one to the complete neglect of the other.</p><p>In <em>The Crucified King</em>,<em> </em>Jeremy Treat demonstrates that Scripture presents a mutually enriching relationship between the kingdom and atonement that draws significantly from the story of Israel and culminates in the crucifixion of Christ the king. As Israel&#x2019;s messiah, he holds together the kingdom and the cross by bringing God&#x2019;s reign on earth through his atoning death. The kingdom is the ultimate goal of the cross, and the cross is the means by which the kingdom comes. Jesus&#x2019; death is not the failure of his messianic ministry, nor simply the prelude to his royal glory, but is the apex of his kingdom mission. The cross is the throne from which he rules and establishes his kingdom.</p><p>Using a holistic approach that brings together the insights of biblical and systematic theology, this book demonstrates not only <em>that</em> the kingdom and the cross are inseparable, but <em>how</em> they are integrated in Scripture and theology.</p></p><p><p>Jeremy Treat (PhD, Wheaton College) is pastor for preaching and vision at Reality LA, a young, thriving church in Los Angeles, California, and adjunct professor of theology at Biola University. He is the award-winning author of <em>The Crucified King: Atonement and Kingdom in Biblical and Systematic Theology.</em></p>Jeremy Treat brings together what many have rented asunder: the cross of Christ and the kingdom of God. For too long many theological tribes have either preached a message about the cross addressed to individuals and opted out of kingdom business or embarked on a campaign of kingdom-work springing from Jesus&#x2019; kingdom-vision and struggled to treat the cross meaningfully. Treat shows that such a division is absolutely foreign to the biblical texts and to the testimony of the historical church. In a venerable banquet of biblical exegesis, biblical theology, and systematic reflections, Treat shows that God&#x2019;s reign and God&#x2019;s redemption are both out workings of the cross of our crucified Lord. Treat brings sanity and sensibility to a controversial topic that should not even be controversial. Judicious, balanced, informative, and compelling! -- Michael F. Bird, Lecturer in Theology at Ridley Melbourne Mission and Ministry College, Australia<br><br>In The Crucified King, Jeremy Treat makes a helpful start toward re-integrating what should never have been torn asunder: not only God's kingdom and Christ&#x2019;s atoning work, but also biblical theology and theological reflection. -- Daniel J. Treier, Blanchard Professor of Theology, Wheaton College<br><br>The Crucified King contributes to the current revivification of the doctrine of the atonement, exploring how the Cross and Kingdom are necessary and mutually interpretative realities. The Cross, he argues, is the in-breaking of God&#x2019;s eschatological kingdom into the present, while Cross sums up the nature of divine and human servant-kingship. This is a delightful work of biblical and systematic theology, ripe with implications for the church&#x2019;s understanding of the cross of Christ as its basis and goal. -- Adam Johnson, Assistant Professor of Theology, Torrey Honors Institute, Biola University<br><br>Jesus came proclaiming the kingdom of God but then died on the cross. The first great virtue of The Crucified King is that it tackles head-on this great riddle at the heart of the New Testament, clarifying how what happened to Jesus, far from contradicting his message, served rather to confirm and explain it. The book's second strength is that it reconciles two views of Jesus&#x2019; death on the cross that have for too long been rivals rather than partners: the penal substitution and Christus Victor theories of atonement. The third strength is that it reconciles the story of redemption (biblical theology) and its logic (systematic theology). Three tensions; three proposed resolutions: blessed are the peacemakers! -- Kevin J. Vanhoozer, Research Professor of Systematic Theology, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>I feel like I&#x2019;ve witnessed a beautiful wedding where the atmosphere is just right, the visuals are perfect, and the bride and groom are perfect for one another. Pastors and theologians often manage to give the impression that the Kingdom of God and the Cross of the Messiah are divorced or separated. Treat's study of Kingdom and Cross unveils the exciting marriage between two of Scripture's central concepts. With good writing and clear thinking of the 'big picture' variety, he produces a dessert-quality dissertation that leaves readers enriched and satisfied. On the evidence of this work, Treat will have an important voice in the theological conversations of the next generation of Christian scholars. -- Jason Hood, St. Margaret&#x2019;s Anglican Church, Moshi, Tanzania</p><h2>Rapunzel, the One With All the Hair: A Wish Novel (Twice Upon a Time #1) (1)</h2><p>Rapunzel is having the ultimate bad day.

Auerbach, <em>City Historian</em>, Passaic, New Jersey</strong></p><p>At the dawn of the 20th century, the social unrest in Paterson, New Jersey was palpable.

Cricket Explained takes the reader from the game's fundamentals -- basic rules, terminology, equipment -- to the finer points of strategy, individual playing styles, and cricket lore. <br>The book includes a combined glossary/index for easy reference and is illustrated throughout with the lighthearted drawings of British cartoonist Mark Stevens. So even if you don't know "short leg" from "silly mid off" or a bowler from a batsman, you'll come away from Cricket Explained with an understanding for this truly international sport which, like baseball, is loved both for its elegant simplicity and its vexing complexity. <br>Among the topics covered in Cricket Explained's concise, user-friendly entries are: <br>-- Cricket's history<br>-- Making sense of the action on the field<br>-- Batsmen and the batting order<br>-- Fielders and fielding positions<br>-- Fielding and batting tactics<br>-- Scoring and statistics<br>-- Bowling strategy<br>-- How many players are required<br>-- How runs are scored, outs are made, and a game is won<br>-- Umpires and the rules<br>-- Bowlers and their individual styles<br>-- Different types of cricket played throughout the world</p></p><p><b>Rob Eastaway</b> is a writer, lecturer and cricket-lover. He is a life-long follower of Lancashire CCC and spends his summer weekends playing cricket-he is one of those bowlers who rub the ball on their trousers. His other books include <i>Why Do Buses Come in Threes?, How Long Is a Piece of String? </i>and <i>Mindbenders and Brainteasers.</i>The complexities of the game of cricket are lost on most Americans. Eastaway, an avid cricketer, attempts to remedy this situation in a short yet inclusive look at a sport that is popular in Great Britain as well as numerous nations around the world, usually former British colonies. In addition to dispensing some basic history, the author attempts to show exactly what happens on the playing field, which player does what and why, and what all the baffling terminology (googly, flipper, cow corner, tonk, etc.) means. Those already bitten by the cricket "bug" (pun intended) will find this work helpful, but if readers don't have much interest in cricket to begin with, this book will probably not instill any. Written mostly in a question-and-answer format, with illustrations that are more cutesy than useful, this title will probably be of limited interest.

Dr. Aubrey de Grey is perhaps the most bullish of all such researchers. As has been reported in media outlets ranging from <i>60 Minutes</i> to <i>The New York Times,</i> Dr. de Grey believes that the key biomedical technology required to eliminate aging-derived debilitation and death entirely&#x2015;technology that would not only slow but periodically <i>reverse</i> age-related physiological decay, leaving us biologically young into an indefinite future&#x2015;is now within reach.</p><p>In <i>Ending Aging,</i> Dr. de Grey and his research assistant Michael Rae describe the details of this biotechnology. They explain that the aging of the human body, just like the aging of man-made machines, results from an accumulation of various types of damage. As with man-made machines, this damage can periodically be repaired, leading to indefinite extension of the machine's fully functional lifetime, just as is routinely done with classic cars. We already know what types of damage accumulate in the human body, and we are moving rapidly toward the comprehensive development of technologies to remove that -damage. By demystifying aging and its postponement for the nonspecialist reader, de Grey and Rae systematically dismantle the fatalist presumption that aging will forever defeat the efforts of medical science.</p></p><p>People alive today could live to be a thousand years old<br>&nbsp;<br>"His clarion call to action is the message neither of a madman nor a bad man, but of a brilliant, beneficent man of goodwill, who wants only for civilization to fulfill the highest hopes he has for its future."<br>--Dr. Sherwin Nuland, clinical professor of surgery at Yale University School of Medicine and author of <i>How We Die</i> and <i>The Art of Aging</i><br>&nbsp;<br>"Seems to me this man could be put in jail with reasonable cause."<br>--Dr. Martin Raff, emeritus professor of biology at University College London and coauthor of <i>Molecular Biology of the Cell</i><br>&nbsp;<br>A leading researcher sketches the real "fountain of youth" <br>&nbsp;<br>- The most realistic way to combat aging is to rejuvenate the body at the molecular and cellular level, removing accumulated damage and restoring us to a biologically younger state. &nbsp;<br>- Comprehensive rejuvenation therapies can feasibly postpone age-related frailty and disease indefinitely, greatly extending our lives while eliminating, rather than lengthening, the period of late-life frailty and debilitation.&nbsp;<br>- A comprehensive panel of rejuvenation therapies could probably be validated in laboratory mice within a decade.&nbsp; We would then have a good chance of developing it for human use only a decade or two thereafter.&nbsp;<br>- Removing the causes of aging-related deaths will also eliminate all the suffering that aging inflicts on most people in the last years of their lives.&nbsp;<br>- Aging kills 100,000 people a day: old people, yes, but old people are people too.&nbsp; Social concerns about the effects of defeating aging are legitimate but don't outweigh the merits of saving so many lives and alleviating so much suffering.<p><b>Aubrey de Grey</b>, Ph.D., is chairman and chief science officer of the Methuselah Foundation, and editor-in-chief of <i>Rejuvenation Research,</i> the only peer-reviewed academic journal focusing on intervention in aging. He has formulated a wide-ranging plan for the comprehensive and eventually indefinite postponement of age-related physical and mental decline, named SENS (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence). He is the organizer of an ongoing series of conferences and workshops that focus on the key biomedical research relevant to SENS, and he also oversees the Methuselah Foundation's growing sponsorship of SENS research worldwide.</p><p><b>Michael Rae</b> is Dr. de Grey's research assistant. He is a longtime member and onetime board member of the Calorie Restriction Society, a main contributor to the society's "How-to Guide," and a core scientific investigator with the society's Cohort Study, which seeks to document the feasibility of calorie restriction in humans and the potential human translatability of the anti-aging effects observed in laboratory organisms.</p></p><h2>Structure Systems</h2><p>Back in print--the standard work on Heino Engel's structure systems. The hundreds of drawings and photographs reproduced in this hardback volume offer almost endless variations on the many structural systems that can keep buildings together: within a few pages of one another, tents, domes and cubes are shown supported by poles, cables, ribs, rafters and beams. Engel's presentation and explanation of this highly complex material differs fundamentally from others' work on the subject in that he focuses entirely upon the functions and design effects of these mechanisms, without regard for technical details: More than an engineering text, this is a catalogue of ideas and forms for architects and dreamers, a David Macaulay book for adults. <i>Structure Systems</i> skips over more commonly treated special designs and completed buildings for typical, representative and surprising shapes. As a reference work or daydream material, it is an indispensable repertoire of forms.</p><p></p><h2>Another America: The Story of Liberia and the Former Slaves Who Ruled It</h2><p><p><b>The first popular history of the former American slaves who founded, ruled, and lost Africa's first republic</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>In 1820, a group of about eighty African Americans reversed the course of history and sailed back to Africa, to a place they would name after liberty itself. They went under the banner of the American Colonization Society, a white philanthropic organization with a dual agenda: to rid America of its blacks, and to convert Africans to Christianity. The settlers staked out a beachhead; their numbers grew as more boats arrived; and after breaking free from their white overseers, they founded Liberia&#x2015;Africa's first black republic&#x2015;in 1847.</p><p>James Ciment's <i>Another America </i>is the first full account of this dramatic experiment. With empathy and a sharp eye for human foibles, Ciment reveals that the Americo-Liberians struggled to live up to their high ideals. They wrote a stirring Declaration of Independence but re-created the social order of antebellum Dixie, with themselves as the master caste. Building plantations, holding elegant soirees, and exploiting and even helping enslave the native Liberians, the persecuted became the persecutors&#x2015;until a lowly native sergeant murdered their president in 1980, ending 133 years of Americo rule.</p><p>The rich cast of characters in <i>Another America </i>rivals that of any novel. We encounter Marcus Garvey, who coaxed his followers toward Liberia in the 1920s, and the rubber king Harvey Firestone, who built his empire on the backs of native Liberians. Among the Americoes themselves, we meet the brilliant intellectual Edward Blyden, one of the first black nationalists; the Baltimore-born explorer Benjamin Anderson, seeking a legendary city of gold in the Liberian hinterland; and President William Tubman, a descendant of Georgia slaves, whose economic policies brought Cadillacs to the streets of Monrovia, the Liberian capital. And then there are the natives, men like Joseph Samson, who was adopted by a prominent Americo family and later presided over the execution of his foster father during the 1980 coup. </p><p>In making Liberia, the Americoes transplanted the virtues and vices of their country of birth. The inspiring and troubled history they created is, to a remarkable degree, the mirror image of our own.</p></p><p><b>James Ciment</b> is an editor and the author of several books on the history of Africa and the Middle East. He lives in Los Angeles with his wife and two children.ONE <br>The Black <i>Mayflower</i> <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Even to the casual waterfront visitor, there would have been something unusual about the departure preparations of the <i>Elizabeth</i>, an otherwise ordinary-looking three-masted ship berthed on New York City&#x2019;s North River. The goods being loaded onto it&#x2014;farm equipment, artisan tools, the materials to build a gristmill, enough weaponry to arm a company of troops&#x2014;were neither the bulk freight of commerce nor the baggage of travelers planning on a return voyage. The appearance of the <i>Elizabeth</i>&#x2019;s passengers would have likewise caught the eye: they were all either black or mulatto. Most had their families with them, including a couple of dozen children, though there were a few single men and women, too. And on this last day in January 1820, they were about the only people in motion on the normally bustling waterfront. <br>New York City was then on the cusp of greatness, primed to become the young and unnaturally restless nation&#x2019;s gateway to the world. The change was most noticeable in the speed and scale of things. Just two years earlier, a transplanted English merchant named Jeremiah Thompson&#x2014;having made an unparalleled fortune in cotton&#x2014;launched his Black Ball Line, which offered the first regularly scheduled voyages in modern maritime history. At first devoted to freight, the packet ships were quickly adapted to passenger traffic by former merchants in the now-illegal slave trade eager to wring a profit from the business of moving impoverished immigrants across the Atlantic. <br>But on that bitterly cold day in early 1820, nature intervened. Global temperatures at the tail end of the &#x201c;little ice age,&#x201d; as historians call the three centuries between the early 1500s and 1800s, were on average only about a degree colder than normal, but that was enough for the North River to routinely freeze over. Commerce slowed down but New Yorkers did not. So popular were winter promenades across the ice that vendors, many of them former slave women (New York&#x2019;s last slave would not be freed until 1827), set up stands to sell smoked oysters, roasted corn, and baked sweet potatoes from the Manhattan docks to the Jersey Palisades. <br>For the ninety-odd passengers and crew aboard the <i>Elizabeth</i>, however, the ice was no playground. For six days, they struggled with pikes and shovels to break the ship free. As they did so, the passenger list shrank. The Joshua Moses family of Philadelphia, laid low by illness, returned to shore with &#x201c;seeming reluctance.&#x201d;1 The body of a two-year-old was carried off the ship to be interred, without fee, in the vault of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, the city&#x2019;s oldest black congregation. <br>Then came a thaw and, on Sunday, February 6, the ship weighed anchor off White Hall Street, near Battery Park, the naval escort <i>Cyane</i> by its side. &#x201c;We left standing on the wharves, I believe some thousands of people, both white and coloured,&#x201d; recorded one passenger.2 But even though contemporaries likened the sailing of the <i>Elizabeth</i> to that of the <i>Mayflower</i> from England exactly two centuries before, the mood was not celebratory. For the &#x201c;coloured&#x201d; people in the crowd, it was a solemn occasion; some were there to bid farewell to friends and loved ones, others to witness a bittersweet moment in the history of their people. For the whites in attendance, there was satisfaction of various sorts. A few saw a group of despised and degraded people at long last set free. Many others simply subtracted ninety or so &#x201c;niggers&#x201d; from a population that darkened the soil of a white man&#x2019;s republic. <br>For the <i>Elizabeth</i>&#x2019;s passengers, the first of thousands of black Americans who would eventually settle in what would come to be known as Liberia, it was surely a moment of great, and conflicting, emotion: They would have felt sadness over leaving loved ones behind, fear of what awaited them on a continent none of them knew much about, and relief about leaving the burden of race behind. They watched the harbor come alive to enterprise and opportunity as the ice melted, and beyond the harbor they saw a city and a nation with a limitless future&#x2014;a nation, they had been told since birth in ways both subtle and crude, that did not belong to them. <br>Little is known of most of these emigrants. They were a mixed lot. Just over half were male, about one-third were children, and roughly two-thirds were residents of either New York or Pennsylvania. About half had a notation in the ship&#x2019;s registry indicating if they were literate or not. (Roughly three-quarters of the respondents were.) Twenty or so had their occupations listed. Of these, about a third were farmers and the rest artisans of various kinds, carpenters constituting the largest group. Just two of the passengers, a nurse from New York City and a popular minister from Baltimore, would qualify as professionals. There was, however, one aspect of their lives that unified them and, at the same time, distinguished them from the vast majority of their fellow African Americans: They were not slaves. <br>The 1820 census revealed that of the roughly 9.6 million persons, other than nontaxed Indians, living in the twenty-four states and various territories between the Atlantic Ocean and the Missouri River, some 1.75 million were nonwhites, all but a handful of them of African or mixed-African origin. And of these people, just 229,620&#x2014;or 13 percent&#x2014;were free, all of them exceptions to two of the oldest rules of antebellum American life: race is destiny and blackness equals slavery. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Daniel Coker and Lott Carey were exceptional men within this exceptional minority. Each had, through hard work and by taking great risks, escaped from bondage and made as much of themselves as early nineteenth-century America allowed a black man to make. And each, as he pushed up against the limits of freedom, would relinquish one struggle only to take up another, abandoning the only country that he knew for a continent that, by all contemporary accounts, was a land of &#x201c;burning sun and tortuous [ <i>sic</i>] insects&#x2014;poisonous exhalations, corrupted water&nbsp;&#x2026; unwholesome food,&#x201d;3 and savage men, a &#x201c;graveyard&#x201d; for civilized persons. Coker sailed on the <i>Elizabeth</i>, while Lott would leave a year later on the ship that followed. Each, in turn, would lead the first emigrants as they struggled to survive in West Africa. Beyond these similarities, though, their lives and fates could not have been more different. <br>Coker was a child of relative privilege, if that word can be applied to a black man of his race and time. He was born in Frederick, Maryland, around 1780, the son of a slave and an Irish indentured servant who worked on a neighboring plantation. While his parentage represented that rarer and more scandalous of interracial liaisons&#x2014;black man, white woman&#x2014;mixed-race persons were often the rule rather than the exception in free black communities throughout the South. Mulattoes were typically the first to be manumitted, and they often exited bondage with a trade or a rudimentary education, skills that helped them better navigate freedom. But they also lived in racial limbo, not always trusted by their darker free black neighbors and viewed by many whites as an affront to the God-given racial order. Coker himself would take up such attitudes, later declaring racial amalgamation &#x201c;truly disgraceful to both colours.&#x201d;4 <br>Coker was not born free, odd given the laws and customs of the South, where the mother&#x2019;s status usually passed to the child. But he became a favorite around the plantation and the inseparable companion of one of his master&#x2019;s sons, who refused to go to school without him. The &#x201c;peculiar institution,&#x201d; of course, made no room for the education of slaves, and for good reason. A literate slave often meant a discontented slave, and one with the ability to make his way in the wider world. Coker&#x2019;s life offered all the evidence slave owners would have needed for the proscription. He escaped to New York City in his teens, joining one of the largest free black communities in the country, and by twenty was a lay minister. In 1801, he returned to his home state and became the first black teacher at the African Academy, a school for free blacks, and the first licensed black minister in Baltimore, even though technically he remained a slave until he was purchased and freed by a Quaker abolitionist five years later. <br>The ambitious Coker went on to found his own school and, in 1810, blazed yet another trail by writing <i>A Dialogue Between a Virginian and an African Minister</i>, the first abolitionist tract published by an African American. Frustrated at the reluctance of white church officials to let black members run their own affairs, he set up his own Methodist congregation in 1814 and raised the money to buy a building to preach in. Two years later, he joined with the pioneering churchman Richard Allen of Philadelphia to found the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first national black church. But Coker soon had a falling-out with Allen and the congregation, though over what is not exactly clear. It may have had to do with color, as many members objected to a mixed-race person&#x2014;contemporary accounts and portraits reveal Coker as extremely light-skinned, with pronounced Caucasian features&#x2014;becoming bishop. Ultimately, the dark-skinned Allen was chosen. Or it may have had to do with his views on African colonization. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>In the first decades of the nineteenth century, free blacks represented the fastest-growing segment of the American population. Many of them had run away during the revolution, while others had been freed by slave owners who took the rhetoric of the struggle against Britain&#x2014;&#x201c; <i>all</i> men are created equal&#x201d;&#x2014;to heart. Since even these enlightened masters&#x2014;George Washington, most notably&#x2014;usually stipulated that freedom would be granted upon their deaths, manumissions surged after 1800. Nowhere was this population explosion more evident than in the three-state region (Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia) surrounding the Chesapeake, a region that was home to a majority of immigrants to Liberia and to the white men who sent them there. <br>The idea of colonization was not new in 1820. Thomas Jefferson, for one, had broached it in his <i>Notes on the State of Virginia</i>, written just five years after the Declaration of Independence. &#x201c;Among the Romans emancipation required but one effort,&#x201d; Jefferson wrote. &#x201c;The slave [usually of the same race], when made free, might mix with, without staining the blood of his master. But with us a second is necessary, unknown to history. When freed, he is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture.&#x201d;5 Like most other people of his era, Jefferson loathed the idea of racial amalgamation, but there was also a degree of patronizing charity in his conclusion&#x2014;being the inferior race, free blacks could never possibly compete with whites and so would become a permanent, and permanently oppressed, underclass. <br>The burgeoning free black population of the early 1800s added a new element to the equation: fear. In the paranoid depths of the white imagination, free blacks represented a threat to order: they loitered, they stole, they fenced goods pilfered by slaves, they hid runaway slaves or shepherded them to freedom, and, worst of all, in the dark of night, they gathered with their still-enslaved friends and family in dirt-floored plantation cabins, infecting them with tales of an idle and carefree life on the other side. Their very presence lowered property values. <br>It was with these fears in mind that a group of men met on the evening of the winter solstice of 1816, in the tavern of the Davis Hotel in Washington, a smoky, shabby brick affair that was nevertheless a favorite haunt of the district&#x2019;s power brokers. Attending this initial plenary session of what would come to be called the American Colonization Society was a veritable who&#x2019;s who of early nineteenth-century movers and shakers: Congressman John Randolph of Virginia, Representative Robert Wright of Maryland, several members of the prestigious Lee clan, the lobbyist (and part-time lyricist) Francis Scott Key, the aging &#x201c;lion of New Hampshire,&#x201d; Senator Daniel Webster, as well as key members of the clergy, the business community, and the law profession.* Although not in attendance, Bushrod Washington&#x2014;Supreme Court justice and closest living link to his demigod uncle&#x2014;agreed to serve as the new society&#x2019;s president, though in what all viewed as a figurehead capacity. <br>No attendee commanded more respect than the man presiding over the meeting. Henry Clay, &#x201c;Star of the West&#x201d; and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, was the second most powerful individual in America. Later known as &#x201c;the great compromiser&#x201d; for his attempts to forge a North-South consensus on slavery, no one represented the conventional wisdom of Washington better than Clay. His opening remarks set the tone of the meeting and the course of the organization: &#x201c;Can there be a nobler cause,&#x201d; he asked, &#x201c;than that which, whilst it proposed to rid our country of a useless and pernicious, if not dangerous portion of its population, contemplates the spreading of the arts of civilized life, and the possible redemption from ignorance and barbarism of a benighted quarter of the globe!&#x201d;6 The benighted quarter Clay and his audience had in mind was Africa. <br>Clay&#x2019;s words were inspiring, even if they amounted to a call for what later generations would have called ethnic cleansing. But what magical transformation did he expect to occur during the crossing that would turn a &#x201c;useless and pernicious&#x201d; people into heralds of &#x201c;civilized life&#x201d;? And who had the money or ships to send the hundreds of thousands of free blacks to Africa anyway? Ultimately, the society would extract a risibly inadequate $100,000 from Congress, under the guise of establishing a haven for recaptives&#x2014;Africans rescued by the U.S. Navy from the recently banned international slave trade&#x2014;and raise modest sums from supporters, mostly through appeals to evangelical congregations in the North and Upper South.* Still, as overblown as Clay&#x2019;s rhetoric now seems, and as daunting the logistical obstacles to the goal he set for the ACS were, his plan had an even more fundamental flaw&#x2014;as events one hundred miles to the north would soon reveal. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>It did not take long for word of the ACS&#x2019;s founding to spread to Philadelphia&#x2019;s free black community, the nation&#x2019;s largest and most influential. Its leading members&#x2014;including Allen, Coker, and one of America&#x2019;s richest black men, the sail manufacturer James Forten&#x2014;supported the ACS&#x2019;s plan on first hearing it, until they presented it to the men and women whose interests they purported to represent. A public meeting convened in mid-January to calmly discuss the merits and defects of colonization quickly turned into something else entirely, as speaker after speaker blasted the motives, methods, and aims of the ACS. Then Forten put the question to the three thousand attendees at the Bethel Church. The &#x201c;aye&#x201d; vote was met by a resounding hush while the &#x201c;nay,&#x201d; he reported, &#x201c;seemed as it would bring down the walls of the building.&#x201d;7 <br>The community&#x2019;s uniform response startled its leadership. After all, the very first effort at colonization, an expedition of thirty-eight led by the wealthy whaling merchant Paul Cuffe the year before, had spurred vigorous debate in the free black community, not outright condemnation. But then Cuffe was black. Whereas Philadelphia&#x2019;s black leadership frequently met with well-meaning white reformers and evangelicals as near equals, ordinary free blacks knew only fear in their encounters with whites. As Forten&#x2019;s own gr...</p><h2>Four of Us: Pasternak, Akhmatova, Mandelstam, Tsvetaeva</h2><p>"....The fact of the matter is that everything that happens in culture ultimately comes down to this, to the four famous temperaments: melancholic, sanguine, phlegmatic, and choleric. That&#x2019;s what I think. It seems to me that our Big Four can also be divided by according to these temperaments, inasmuch as all of them are actually very distinctly represented in the group. Tsvetaeva is unquestionably the choleric author. Pasternak is sanguine. Mandelstam is melancholic. And Akhmatova is phlegmatic. Together they cover the whole poetic universe." -Joseph Brodsky Included in this dual-language book is a selection of 10 poems from each poet translated into English by Andrey Kneller.</p><p>Anna Akhmatova (1889-1966) is known as one of twentieth-century Russia&#39;s greatest poets. She suffered repression under Stalinism and after World War II; her literary achievement was finally internationally recognized in the final years of her life.</p><h2>Miss Dorothy and Her Bookmobile</h2><p><p>When Dorothy was a young girl, she loved books, and she loved people, so she decided that she would become a librarian.</p><p>Dorothy's dearest wish is to be a librarian in a fine brick library just like the one she visited when she was small. But her new home in North Carolina has valleys and streams but no libraries, so Miss Dorothy and her neighbors decide to start a bookmobile. Instead of people coming to a fine brick library, Miss Dorothy can now bring the books to them&#x2014;at school, on the farm, even once in the middle of a river! </p><p><em>Miss Dorothy and Her Bookmobile</em> is an inspiring story about the love of books, the power of perseverance, and how a librarian can change people's lives. </p></p><p><p>Gloria Houston is the author of numerous books for children, including <em>My Great-Aunt Arizona</em>, illustrated by Susan Condie Lamb, which was a Smithsonian Treasure, a Family Channel's Best Book, an IRA Teachers' and Children's Choices book, and an NCTE Best Book, among other honors. She also wrote <em>The Year of the Perfect Christmas Tree</em>, illustrated by Barbara Cooney, which was an annual <em>Publishers Weekly</em> Bestseller and was named a Best Book of the Decade by the American Library Association. She currently lives in North Carolina.</p><br><br><p>Susan Condie Lamb has illustrated several other picture books for children, including the beloved <em>My Great-Aunt Arizona</em> by Gloria Houston. Now writing and illustrating her own projects, Susan lives in Connecticut.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 2&#x2014;Based on the librarian from the author's childhood, the story follows one woman's dedication to bringing reading material to people in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. Starting with hauling books up from her basement to later driving around in the town's green bookmobile, Miss Dorothy eventually inspires the town to purchase a building for a library of their very own. Beautiful, soft landscapes of the rugged terrain throughout the seasons serve as a backdrop for this charming story of a librarian on the go. While Miss Dorothy's dreams of a stately brick building as a true library seems to undermine the worth of the bookmobile a bit, the overall effect is that of nostalgia and a sweet homage to a special woman. Most adult readers have a memory of a Miss Dorothy in their lives, be it a teacher, neighbor, or librarian, and most children will enjoy this look back in time. A lovely addition to any collection.&#x2014;<i>Sarah Townsend, Norfolk Public Library, VA</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2011. &nbsp;Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

Over the course of time Olympian luster diminished in favor of religious experiences more immediate to the concerns of people living in an increasingly cosmopolitan ancient world. These experiences were provided by the mysteries, religions that flourished particularly during the Hellenistic period and were secretly practiced by groups of adherents who decided, through personal choice, to be initiated into the profound realities of one deity or another. Unlike the official state religions, in which people were expected to make an outward show of allegiance to the local gods, the mysteries emphasized an inwardness and privacy of worship within a closed band of initiates.</p><p>In this book, Marvin W. Meyer explores the sacrifices and prayers, the public celebrations and secret ceremonies, the theatrical performances and literary works, the gods and goddesses that were a part of the mystery religions of Greece in the seventh century B.C. to the Judaism and Christianity of the Roman world of the seventh century A.D.</p></p><p>The best English translations of forty sacred texts describing the mystery religions of the ancient Mediterranean world.Marvin W.

For her own part, Taylor spent four years&#x2015;without pay or formal training&#x2015;nursing sick and wounded members of a black regiment of Union soldiers. In addition, she worked as a camp cook, laundress, and teacher. Written from a perspective unique in the literature of the Civil War, <i>Reminiscences of My Life in Camp</i> not only chronicles daily life on the battlefront but also records interactions between blacks and whites, men and women, and Northerners and Southerners during and after the war.Taylor tells of being born into slavery and of learning, in secret, to read and write. She describes maturing under her wartime responsibilities and traveling with the troops in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. After the war, Taylor dedicated herself to improving the lives of black Southerners and black Union Army veterans. The final chapters of <i>Reminiscences</i> are filled with depictions of the racism to which these efforts often exposed her.</p><p>This volume reproduces the text of the original 1902 edition.

Designing and monitoring studies, obtaining and analyzing scientific data, and reconciling clinical results against the ethical constraints and regulatory guidelines of government agencies, requires a complex interaction of in-house specialists and academic and commercial consultants worldwide. Scientific, technical, and tactical considerations play out in an environment where a balance must be struck between the often-competing interests of the corporation, its investors, government regulators, and the safety and well being of intended patients. All the while, dwindling patent protections impose an ever-contracting timeframe for success. Written to be accessible to a wide audience, NEW DRUGS provides a thorough, succinct, and practical understanding of these drug-development processes. If you&#x2019;re involved in the pharmaceutical industry, NEW DRUGS will provide scientific and management tools to increase the likelihood of regulatory approval at each phase of your compound&#x2019;s development. If you&#x2019;re a patient or consumer, NEW DRUGS will enable you to intelligently discuss medications with your health-care provider and empower you to make informed decisions at the pharmacy. If your portfolio, rather than your health, makes you an interested observer of the fortunes of this critical sector of the US economy, NEW DRUGS will help you to decode press releases and annual reports, so that you can recognize and invest in well-run companies with promising products.</p><p>During his 30-year career in pharmaceutical research and development, author Lawrence T. Friedhoff, MD, PhD, FACP has amassed an extraordinary record of industry accomplishments, most notably as the head of the teams that chose, developed, and brought two chemical compounds through regulatory approvals around the world. These new drugs are market &#x201c;blockbusters,&#x201d; each used by millions of patients and each generating well over $1 billion annual revenue worldwide. Dr. Friedhoff's first-hand knowledge of pharmaceutical R&amp;D is extensive and comprehensive: he has held management positions at multi-national corporations developing novel drug compounds, small publicly-traded companies manufacturing generic drugs, start-up ventures, and academic-based research teams writing business plans to obtain venture capital. As an R&amp;D head, he held primary responsibility for choosing drug candidates and preparing comprehensive plans for, as well as managing all phases of, their development, always with an eye towards fulfilling FDA (and often, European and Asian) drug requirements. He has also managed post-FDA-approval activities including collecting and analyzing adverse-event information from consumers, fielding inquiries from patients and healthcare providers, and marketing-related scientific studies. Although the press contains numerous reports of disastrous failed clinical trials, during Dr. Friedhoff's career none of the completed pivotal clinical trials for which he was fully responsible ever failed and all of his new drug applications (NDAs) submitted to the FDA were approved. Few industry professionals have been able match his achievements."This is an excellent primer on the drug development process that importantly stresses the inter-relationship of studies in each part of the process. I will not only use this book in my course on drug discovery but will also recommend it to faculty interested in translational research." --<i>Anthony Giordano, PhD Assistant Dean of Research and Business Development, Office of Research and Director, Experimental Therapeutics, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center Louisiana State University, Shreveport, LA</i><br><br>"Dr. Friedhoff has been a very effective consultant to our firm, and we have profited greatly from his insights.

What are its core mechanisms? What value do contemplative practices add to approaches that are already effective? From leading meditation teacher Christina Feldman and distinguished psychologist Willem Kuyken, this book provides a uniquely integrative perspective on mindfulness and its applications. The authors explore mindfulness from its roots in Buddhist psychology to its role in contemporary psychological science. In-depth case examples illustrate how and why mindfulness training can help people move from distress and suffering to resilience and flourishing. Readers are guided to consider mindfulness not only conceptually, but also experientially, through their own journey of mindfulness practice.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Christina Feldman is a leading senior teacher in the insight meditation community, offering retreats internationally.

In particular, his research examines how mindfulness and mindfulness-based programs can prevent depression and enhance human potential across the lifespan. Dr. Kuyken has published more than 100 journal articles, including key papers on the effectiveness, mechanisms, and implementation of mindfulness-based programs."A tour de force. This book elaborates in exquisite detail--yet with utter accessibility and clarity--what mindfulness is and where it comes from, as well as its profound ethical foundation, clinical applications, growing evidence base, and potential for healing. The depth of the case studies alone exemplifies the elemental wisdom inherent to the practice of mindfulness, and how it can be applied in trying and challenging life situations to beneficial effect."--Jon Kabat-Zinn, founder of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)<br><br> "Given the widespread appeal of mindfulness training, there is a growing need to understand what mindfulness actually is (and is not!), and to see the ancient roots of its modern applications. Bringing together their own deep practice of meditation with sophisticated psychological expertise and the latest neuroscience research, the authors have created a comprehensive map of the mind. This book illuminates the range and transformative power, both secular and spiritual, of mindfulness practice."--Joseph Goldstein, cofounder, Insight Meditation Society, Barre, Massachusetts<br><br> "This inspiring book builds bridges between Buddhist psychology and contemporary science. This integration is vital in our world--it has the potential to radically transform perspectives and relieve suffering for individuals and communities. Highly renowned in their respective fields, Feldman and Kuyken are professionally and personally invested in discovering what can emerge from bringing ancient and contemporary disciplines together. This resource will be profoundly useful to so many of us."--Rebecca Crane, PhD, Director, Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice, Bangor University, United Kingdom<br><br> "This book provides a much-needed view of the lay of the land for mindfulness in the 21st century. Drawing on their many years of experience in practicing, investigating, and teaching within the Buddhist insight meditation tradition, on the one hand, and contemporary psychological science, on the other, Feldman and Kuyken offer a remarkably elegant and profound demonstration of what they name as the 'mutuality of learning and dialogue' between the two worlds. Their book shows clearly how and why such mutuality has transformative potential, and the conditions under which it may or may not flourish. This book is a 'must read' for students and teachers of mindfulness-based approaches."--Mark Williams, DPhil, Emeritus Professor of Clinical Psychology, University of Oxford, United Kingdom<br><br> "You are holding in your hands a profound work that brings much-needed clarity to the synergies and tension between Buddhist psychology and psychological science.

While a lot has been written on ethical and strategic factors, there is still a dearth of information on the practical nuts and bolts. And whereas with most other organizational initiatives the sole objective is improved financial performance, sustainability broadens the focus to include social and environmental performance, which is much more difficult to measure.<br><br> Now updated throughout with new examples and new research, this is a complete guide to implementing and measuring the effectiveness of sustainability initiatives. It draws on Marc Epstein&#x2019;s and new coauthor Adriana Rejc Buhovac&#x2019;s solid academic foundation and extensive consulting work and includes best practices from dozens of companies in Europe, Asia, North America, South America, Australia, and Africa. This is the ultimate how-to guide for corporate leaders, strategists, academics, sustainability consultants, and anyone else with an interest in actually putting sustainability ideas into practice and making sure they accomplish their goals.</p><p>Marc J.

We follow the lives and careers of four women who were largely written out of history - until now. <br><br>Magdalena Yesil, who arrived in America from Turkey with $43 to her name, would go on to receive her electrical engineering degree from Stanford, found some of the first companies to commercialize internet access, and help Marc Benioff build Salesforce. Mary Jane Elmore went from the corn fields of Indiana to Stanford and on to the storied venture capital firm IVP - where she was one of the first women in the U.S. to make partner - only to be pulled back from the glass ceiling by expectations at home. Theresia Gouw, an overachieving first-generation Asian American from a working-class town, dominated the foosball tables at Brown (she would later reluctantly let Sergey Brin win to help Accel Partners court Google), before she helped land and build companies including Facebook, Trulia, Imperva, and ForeScout. Sonja Hoel, a Southerner who became the first woman investing partner at white-glove Menlo Ventures, invested in McAfee, Hotmail, Acme Packet, and F5 Networks. As her star was still rising at Menlo, a personal crisis would turn her into an activist overnight, inspiring her to found an all-women's investment group and a national nonprofit for girls.<br><br>These women, juggling work and family, shaped the tech landscape we know today while overcoming unequal pay, actual punches, betrayals, and the sexist attitudes prevalent in Silicon Valley and in male-dominated industries everywhere. Despite the setbacks, they would rise again to rewrite the rules for an industry they love. In <i>Alpha Girls</i>, Guthrie reveals their untold stories.</p><p><b>Julian Guthrie</b> spent twenty years writing for the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, where she won numerous awards and had her writing nominated multiple times for the Pulitzer Prize. She is the author of three nonfiction books: <i>The Grace of Everyday Saints</i>, <i>The Billionaire and the Mechanic</i>, and <i>How to Make a Spaceship</i>. She lives in the San Francisco Bay Area.<b>PROLOGUE</b><br><b>SAND HILL ROAD</b><br><b>MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA</b><br>Mary Jane Elmore was giddy as she looked down at the rusted-out floorboards of her old green Ford Pinto. She could see the road rushing by below. But she wasn&#x2019;t driving on just any road. She was making her way up Sand Hill Road, in the heart of Silicon Valley, about to start a new life intent on changing the world.<br><br>A pretty young woman with brown hair and brown eyes, Mary Jane had graduated from Purdue University in 1976 with a degree in mathematics. She paid for her car by waitressing during college summers, wearing a small orange romper that prompted oversize tips. Her beat-up Pinto, which leaked radiator fluid and still had its original Firestone 500 tires, had taken her nearly two thousand miles, from Kansas City to northern California, where she had landed a job at an eight-year-old technology company called Intel.<br><br>Although Sand Hill Road was the center of the venture capital world, no bronze statue of a charging bull, no Gilded Age architecture, and no artificial canyons towered over by gleaming skyscrapers commemorated it. At that time it was a stretch of rolling land laced with scrub brush, sprawling oak trees, big pink dahlias, and buildings that stretched long and low like an old Lincoln Continental. The midcentury modern structures, with outer skins of cedar, redwood, and masonry, featured numbers but no names. Unlike other centers of commerce, Sand Hill Road is intentionally inconspicuous; it consciously resists contemporary symbols of money and power. Instead, it is country club hush. To Mary Jane, it was a world away from the tall cornfields where she had skittered about as a child, playing hide-and-seek, moving three rows up and four rows over, strategic and mathematical in her decision making even then.<br><br>Her aptitude in math&#x2014;not to mention a prescient feel for the markets&#x2014;would make Mary Jane particularly well suited for this new California frontier. And in the 1970s, that was exactly what Silicon Valley felt like, a frontier, steeped in the aggressive and hungry spirit of the Gold Rush, of adventurers and fortune seekers risking everything for a glimmer of gold, aware that only a lucky few walked away winners. The original Gold Rush days of 1849 were dominated by mining companies and merchants hawking overpriced goods. It was ruled by men: Samuel Brannan, Levi Strauss, John Studebaker, Henry Wells, and William Fargo. Women, outnumbered and overmatched, were mostly reduced to entertainers, companions, wives, or housekeepers. Things were not that different in the more recent gold rush. The Valley was always a region dominated by men, from William Hewlett, Dave Packard, Bob Noyce, Gordon Moore, Andy Grove, Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs, and Steve Wozniak to, decades later, in the twenty-first century, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Tim Cook, Travis Kalanick, and Marc Benioff.<br><br>Mary Jane, fueled by peanut butter sandwiches packed in wax paper for the two-day journey, was under no illusion that it would be easy to navigate the old boys&#x2019; club of Sand Hill Road and Silicon Valley. Even today, decades after Mary Jane first arrived, 94 percent of investing partners at venture capital firms&#x2014;the financial decision makers shaping the future&#x2014;are men, and more than 80 percent of venture firms have never had a woman investing partner. Less than 2 percent of venture dollars go to start-ups founded by women (less than 1 percent to women of color), and roughly 85 percent of the tech employees at top companies are men. Yet technology is pervasive, and it is changing our lives. When Mary Jane first drove up Sand Hill, women made up barely 40 percent of the overall American workforce. Less than a handful of those women were venture capital partners.<br><br>But Mary Jane Elmore, the unflappable, fresh-faced girl next door, would go on to become one of the first women in history to make partner at a venture capital firm. Like the bold pink dahlias flourishing in one corner of Sand Hill Road, she and the other pioneering women venture capitalists, the &#x201c;Alpha Girls,&#x201d; would figure out a way to take root and thrive.<br><br>They made their way west like early-day prospectors during Silicon Valley&#x2019;s headiest days, as enormous mainframe computers gave way to minicomputers, personal computers, and the Internet, just as punched computer cards had at one time set the stage for computation. Through the start-ups they would discover, fund, and mentor&#x2014;financing the ideas of entrepreneurs&#x2014;these women venture capitalists would play a critical role in shaping how people around the world work, play, communicate, study, travel, create, and interact. Venture capitalists influence many of the most important new inventions in drugs, medicine, and technology.<br><br>In addition to Mary Jane, there is Sonja Hoel, a blond, blue-eyed, doggedly optimistic southern belle whose investments at the white-glove Menlo Ventures on Sand Hill Road would focus on making the Internet safer and more reliable; Magdalena Yes�il, a feisty Armenian outsider reared in Istanbul, who loved getting in where she wasn&#x2019;t invited; and Theresia Gouw, an overachieving daughter of Chinese immigrants, who went from flipping burgers at Burger King to chasing down some of the hottest deals in Silicon Valley history. There are other Alpha Girls, too, such as the first investor and board member of Tesla; the woman who started the first venture fund in India; the first woman to take a tech company public; the first women to build an online beauty site; and today a whole new generation of young women financiers and entrepreneurs. These women share a determination with Alpha Girls everywhere, transcending vocation and location, working in Hollywood, academia, economics, advertising, politics, the media, sports, automobiles, agriculture, law, hospitality, restaurants, and the arts.<br><br>History is rich with women rebels who have shined a spotlight from the outside&#x2014;women such as Rosa Parks, whose one defiant act became synonymous with the civil rights movement. But it is also rife with what one academic calls &#x201c;tempered radicals,&#x201d; those who learn to play the game to perfection&#x2014;whatever the game is&#x2014;before trying to change the rules. Margaret Thatcher took elocution lessons to deepen her voice, to better be heard. Georgia O&#x2019;Keeffe painted &#x201c;low-toned dismal-colored&#x201d; paintings like male artists, to show she could, before turning to the bright desert flowers that made her a giant of American modernism.<br><br>As Mary Jane drove up Sand Hill Road on that perfect fall day, she had little sense of the hard&nbsp;realities ahead. She could never have imagined juggling a high-stakes job, three children, a husband aggressively pursuing his own Silicon Valley dreams, and a junior partner with outsize ambitions. But she knew intuitively that this was the right place for her: Silicon Valley was the embodiment of breathtakingly bold ideas and inventions, a region awash in unparalleled ingenuity, originality, tenacity, optimism, and opportunity. It had given rise to more new companies and industries than anywhere else in the world, including such technology giants as Hewlett-Packard, Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel, Teledyne, ROLM, Amgen, Genentech, Advanced Micro Devices, Tandem, Atari, Oracle, Apple, Dell, Electronic Arts, Compaq, FedEx, Netscape, LSI, Yahoo!, Amazon, Cisco, PayPal, eBay, Google, Salesforce, LinkedIn, Tesla, Facebook, YouTube, Uber, Skype, Twitter, and Airbnb.<br><br>But Mary Jane and the other Alpha Girls would need steel in their spines to stay the course, and they would pay a steep emotional price along the way. They would be betrayed when they least expected it. Silicon Valley, teeming with youthful testosterone, is a deceptively rough arena, where bullying, bias, dysfunction, and subjugation are part of the rules of engagement. In the end, the Alpha Girls&#x2014;these resilient daughters of merchants, teachers, dentists, and immigrants&#x2014;would come to realize there was only one way to shake up the industry they loved: by breaking and remaking its rules.</p><h2>Children of the Promise: The Biblical Case for Infant Baptism</h2><p>In his ten-year ministry, he had put off studying the topic of baptism.

He lives in Los Angeles.1.<br><br>I am the third and last son of my family to come out to Afghanistan. My older brothers went out as cavalrymen. I signed with the infantry.<br><br>The distinction between horse and foot is not so great in Afghanistan as it was in Alexander's earlier campaigns in Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and Persia. Out east, an infantryman is expected to leap onto the back of any creature that will bear his weight--horse, mule, ass, or <i>yaboo</i> (the Afghan pony)--and ride to the site of action, there to dismount and fight, or even fight from the beast's back if necessary. Likewise horse troopers, even the King's Companions, think nothing of hitting the ground and slugging it out on foot alongside the dirt-eaters.<br><br>My father was killed in Afghanistan, or more precisely he expired of sepsis in a military hospital in Susia, in the province of Areia, which lies on the western border of the country. My father was not a mounted warrior or a foot soldier but a combat engineer of the siege train--what the troops call a "bucket man" because miners and sappers dig their trenches and raise their earthworks with wicker baskets. His name was the same as mine, Matthias.<br><br>My father fought at the Granicus River, at Tyre, Gaza, and at Issus. He was an authentic hero. My brothers are too. Once, when I was sixteen, my father sent home an army warrant worth a quarter talent of gold. We bought a second farm with it, with two barns and a year-round creek, and had enough left over to fence the place in stone.<br><br>It was my father's keenest wish that I, the youngest brother, not come out to war. My mother, further, was violently opposed to any step that would take me away from the land. "You may call it your misfortune, Matthias," she declared, "to have been whelped last of the litter. But, like it or not, you are my bulwark and the bulwark of this farm. Your father is gone. We shall never see your brothers again. Lust for glory will be their finish; they will leave great names and nothing more."<br><br>My mother feared that I, gone overseas, would tread into the snare of some foreign wench and, taking her to wife, never return to Macedon.<br><br>I was eighteen, however, and as mad for glory as every other overheated young blood in a kingdom whose twenty-five-year-old sovereign, Alexander son of Philip, had in only four years sacked earth's mightiest empire and turned our homeland delirious with conquest, fame, and treasure.<br><br>In the Macedonian army, enlistments are measured not by years but by cycles, or "bumps." A bump is eighteen months. Minimum enlistment is two bumps, one to be trained and one to serve, but a man must commit for a third cycle, a total of four and a half years, if and when he is called overseas. It worked this way: A recruit entered service with a regiment of the Occupation Army. This was the force left behind by Alexander to hold down Greece and the tribal north. All these contingents were territorial; you had to come from the district or you couldn't get in. As Alexander's needs in Asia necessitated, he sent home for replacements. Sometimes entire regiments were called up; other times individuals, either those in specific military specialties such as intelligence or siege engineering, or simply infantrymen with seniority whose lucky number came up.<br><br>All this was moot for a youth of my district, Apollonia. Apollonia has no infantry regiment. The region is cavalry country. The most famous squadron of Alexander's Companions, the ile of Socrates Sathon, comes from Apollonia. This squadron, in which both my brothers served, led the charge at the battle of the Granicus River; it fought at Alexander's right hand in the great victories of Issus and Gaugamela. It has more hero statues at Dium than any other squadron, including the Royal. My best friend Lucas and I, and every other war-crazed youth in the territory, had trained year-round since before we could walk, on fire for the day we would enter the trials and with heaven's aid become, like Apollonia's heroes before us, King's Companions.<br><br>We were too late, Lucas and I. By the time our hour came, Alexander's army had pushed so deep into Asia and had assimilated troops from so many vanquished nations that our king no longer sent home for Companion cavalry, except to replace men killed, wounded, or retired. The horse troops he employed now were all hired squadrons--Persians mostly, with Syrians, Lydians, Cappadocians, and riders of other kingdoms of the conquered East. No Mack could join these, even if he could get overseas, which he couldn't, or could speak the barbarian tongue, which he wouldn't.<br><br>There was only one way for Lucas and me to get out to Asia. As hired infantry. As mercenaries.<br><br>At that time, scores of private contractors--called pilophoroi for the felt caps they wore--traveled the cities of Greece and Asia Minor, signing up troops. It was a business. Candidates paid a fee, called a "pony" because it was so steep a man could buy a fine colt with it. The felt-caps got them in.<br><br>Turning eighteen, Lucas and I trekked three days to the port of Methone, the hiring depot for mercenary infantry. The taverns were crawling with grizzled professionals--Arcadians and Syracusans, Cretans and Rhodians, even officers of the Achaeans and Spartans. They all knew each other from prior hitches; they had mates and commanders who could get them aboard. Lucas and I were the youngest by years. We knew nobody. No pilophoros would touch us, no matter how convincingly we lied about our age or our service histories (of which we had none).<br><br>We stayed ten days, with our payoff cash dwindling rapidly, trying to talk or buy our way in anywhere. At the last hour we went seeking the recruiting general himself. Of course we couldn't get near him. A Line Sergeant from Pella kicked us out. "Wait a minute," he said, hearing our accents. "Are you boys from Apollonia?"<br><br>He wanted to know if we could ride.<br><br>We were centaurs!<br><br>The sergeant drew up our papers on the spot and wouldn't take any money either. He put us down as Mounted Infantry. That was what Alexander needed most. Lucas and I could not believe our luck. We asked what outfit we'd be with and when we'd get our horses.<br><br>"No outfits," the sergeant said. "And no horses neither." He had put us on the rolls because we were Macedonians, amid all these foreigners. "No overseas captain ever turned down a lad from home."<br><br>We thanked him with all our hearts. He brushed it off. "Don't worry about what outfit you ship out with, or if you never see an hour of drill. Out east," he said, "the king'll draft you wherever he needs you."<br>2.<br>Our force of replacements landed at Tripolis in Syria on the sixteenth of Daesius, early summer, in the sixth year of Alexander's reign, the fourth since the expeditionary force had crossed out of Europe into Asia. The king and his army were then a thousand miles east, on their way from Persepolis, Persia's capital, to Ecbatana in Media, the summer palace of her kings. The Persian Empire had fallen; Alexander now pursued its fugitive king. Our lord's pack train, reports said, was seven thousand camels and ten thousand pairs of asses, all laden with gold.<br><br>Our detachment of replacements was sixty-one hundred in forty-seven ships. The harbor at Tripolis couldn't hold that many, and, as the vessels had neither berths nor provisions to lie-to overnight in the roads, a conference was held of the captains, who were just merchant skippers hired for pay, at which it was decided that our ferry (which is what it was) and about ten others would be rowed to shallow water, where we scuffs were told to grab our kit, hop over the side, and swim for it. Which we did. It was a grand lark, except that I ruined a fine pair of boots in the saltwater, growing too weary to hold them over my head. This is how I landed in Asia, soaked as a drowned cat, and barefoot.<br><br>Replacements are not an army. Our mob had been formed not into regiments but into "S.C.'s," shipboard contingents, and did not, when we landed, even have our arms. The cavalry didn't have its horses. The animals were following in other transports. There was a tent city waiting, and an escort of six hundred Syrian mercenaries, and fourteen hundred hired infantry of Lycia, with Macedonian officers, who were to take us up to Marathus and from there by way of Larissa to Thapsacus, where we would cross the Euphrates into Mesopotamian Syria and Kurdistan. The march to catch up with Alexander would take between three and four months.<br><br>As always in a new camp, the troops plunged at once into their favored pastimes--touring the site looking up friends, and poaching every item of kit they could lay hands on. You couldn't set down a heel of bread without somebody snatching it, and a decent hat or a pair of road-slappers were sure goners. A man hung his purse next to his testicles and, after shaking hands with a stranger, checked to make sure both sacks were still where he had left them.<br><br>In Alexander's fighting army, every trooper knew the mark he was to stand on. But here, a thousand miles to the rear, the show was all orphan stew. You ate when the cooks opened the tents and bunked where you could find a patch of dirt wide enough to hold your bones. You kept with your mates to keep the scroungers from picking you blind. My bunch was Lucas; Terres, called "Rags" for his dandy's love of clothes; and Peithon, undersized, called "Flea." We were all from Apollonia, all eighteen, and had known each other all our lives.<br><br>Lucas was our leader. He was a born operator and set out to keep our heads above the general ruck. We were supposed to get paid on landing at Tripolis (it'd been a month, marshaling and crossing), but if there was any shine with this mob, I never saw it. In fact we had to pay, ourselves. The slugs at the cook-tent wanted cash to get in. You had to pay to take a crap.<br><br>"We've got to find ourselves a bull," pronounced Lucas. Meaning someone with rank to attach ourselves to.<br><br>We found him in a Color Sergeant named Tolmides. Tollo for short. He was a stubby fellow with great mustaches and a boar's-tusk cap, a mate of Lucas's father, and in charge here of a company of Lycian infantry. Lucas spotted him in the latrine line. "Hey, Tollo! Where's a scuff take a free shit around here?"<br><br>Tollo came over, laughing. "By Hades' balls, you little off-scourings got all growed up, did you?" His rank was no joke though. He was a big onion. He got us out of camp. We chowed down with his Lycians out on the plain.<br><br>What, we asked, were the chances of getting paid?<br><br>About the same as crapping ivory.<br><br>When do we get assigned to regiments?<br><br>When you pay off the officers escorting you.<br><br>What about kit?<br><br>We would not be issued arms till Thapsacus or later, Tollo told us, and when we did we'd have to cough up for those too. "Don't worry, the quartermaster'll put it against your roll." Meaning our pay records. We'd tick it down out of time served.<br><br>Lucas looked glum. "They didn't tell us this back home."<br><br>"If they did, you wouldn't have come out," said Tollo. And he laughed.<br><br>We glued ourselves to him. He and his Mack comrades had served as scouts in Forward Operations, running reconnaissance for Alexander in Areia and Afghanistan. They had been sent back to train us replacements on the march. They got double pay for this, and double that for escort duty.<br><br>"Don't take to gloom, little brothers." Tollo pointed east, into the Asiatic night. "Men drop like flies out there, from heat, sickness, or they just run queer." And he tapped his skull. "You'll make grade fast if you show strong stuff. Keep your sheet clean and do what you're told. You'll work fine."<br><br>There were six other Macks in Tollo's cadre, including Stephanos of Aegae, the celebrated war poet. He was a decorated hero and a genuine celebrity. Stephanos was thirty-five; he should have been a captain or at least a full lieutenant, but he stayed a Line Sergeant. He liked it that way. Here is one of the poems that had made him famous back home and a favorite, even, of the women.<br>A SOLDIER'S PACK<br><br><i>Experience has taught the soldier how to<br>pack his pannier, with the stuff he needs most<br>near the top, where he can get at it. In the outer pockets<br>he stows his onions and garlic, sealed tight so they don't<br>stink up the weather kit and half-fleece on the other side.<br>At the bottom, deep inside, he stashes those items that must<br>at all costs be protected, against dust, against being<br>dropped, against the elements. There, in the doeskin<br>you gave me, I keep your letters, my darling wife.</i><br>The youngest of these Mack cadre was past thirty; several were fifty and more. They were the roughest planks we had ever seen. We were scared to death of them. Any one, by himself, could have manhandled the pack of us. We found ourselves running errands for them and shouldering their kit, without anyone ordering us, just so they wouldn't bite our heads off. Lucas and I were slouching back into camp with firewood one night when we were called over by one of them, a Flag Sergeant whose real name no one dared ask and whom the troopers called simply "Flag," the customary title of address for one of his rank.<br><br>"You two, learn something."<br><br>We dropped our brush and scurried to him like schoolboys. Flag summoned one of his Lycians and had the fellow face about. He thrust the shaft of his half-pike (the shorter version of the sarissa used then in Asia) into my fist.<br><br>"Kill him," he commanded.<br><br>I turned bright plum. Could he be serious?<br><br>"How do you finish a man who's running from you?"<br><br>I didn't know.<br><br>Flag tugged the Lycian around. "What if he turns about and faces you?"<br><br>I didn't know.<br><br>"Take his place."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>Suddenly I found myself in the Lycian's spot. "Run," Flag commanded. Before I could take one step, I found myself facedown in the dirt with the wind hammered out of me. I didn't even know where Flag had hit me. I felt the butt of his half-pike upend me in one instant, then smash my skull in the next. I couldn't move or breathe; I was helpless.</p><h2>Larry Fink on Composition and Improvisation: The Photography Workshop Series</h2><p><br><br>In this series, Aperture Foundation works with the world's top photographers to distill their creative approaches, teachings, and insights on photography&#x2014;offering the workshop experience in a book. Its goal is to inspire photographers of all levels who wish to improve their work, as well as readers interested in deepening their understanding of the art of photography. Each volume is introduced by a well-known student of the featured photographer.

(Did you know that roasting chestnuts was once used to foretell one's fate?)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the witches roast chestnuts and melt lead to see their fate, a series of odd messengers land on their doorstep bearing invitations for a New Year's Eve masquerade hosted by a woman they've never met. Gossip, dreams and portents follow, leading the witches to question the woman's motives. Is she as benevolent as she seems or is she laying a trap? And so, as Gilded-Age New York prepares to ring in the new year, the witches don their finery and head for the ball, on the hunt for answers that might well be the end of them.</p><p>AMI McKAY's debut novel, <i>The Birth House</i>, was a #1 bestseller in Canada, winner of three CBA Libris Awards, nominated for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, a finalist for Canada Reads and a book-club favourite around the world. Her second novel, <i>The Virgin Cure,</i> a Best Book pick across numerous lists, was inspired by the life of her great-great grandmother, Dr. Sarah Fonda Mackintosh, a female physician in nineteenth-century New York. And with her third, <i>The Witches of New York</i>, also a national bestseller, she was recognized by the <i>Globe and Mail </i>as "one of the country's most beloved storytellers." Born and raised in Indiana, McKay now lives in Nova Scotia.&nbsp;<br> December 29, 1881 <br><br> Christmas Day has come and gone, the New Year lies ahead. Strange things happen Between the Years, in the days outside of time. Minutes go wild, hours vanish. Idleness becomes a clever thief, stealing the names of the days of the week, muting the steady tick of watches and clocks. These are the hours when angels, ghosts, demons and meddlers ride howling wind and flickering candlelight, keen to stir unguarded hearts and restless minds. <br><br> Tonight, the three Witches of New York, swathed in dressing gowns of velvet and silk, are seated on tasseled pillows before a crackling fire.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> They&#x2019;ve set the business of potions, spells and con�sultations aside, in favour of quiet contemplation. The youngest, Beatrice, touchstone of spirits, is curious and bright-eyed. The eldest, Eleanor, keeper of spells, is watchful, regal and wise. Adelaide, seer of fate, sits between them, ever ready to speak her mind. Bellies full of honey cake and hot cider, they seek comfort, warmth, companionship and glimpses of the future. <br><br> Beatrice scores a chestnut with a small knife to prepare it for roasting. &#x201c;My aunt Lydia always said a cracked nut means &#x2018;yes,&#x2019; and one that burns without cracking means &#x2018;no.&#x2019;&#x201d; The fire hisses and pops. A spark flies into the air and lands on the hearth where it pulses, then dies. After placing her chestnut in a shallow pan, she sets the pan on the fire and waits for an answer. <br><br> Eleanor watches with anticipation. So does Perdu, her raven familiar. <br><br> The bird is keen for the sweet roasted meat of the nut. Eleanor, for a morsel of truth. She knows Beatrice is keeping a secret. <br><br> A faint <i>yessss </i>sounds before the chestnut squeals and its shell blossoms in an attempt to turn itself inside out. <br><br> Eleanor stares at her young apprentice. <i>Is she happy, sad or indifferent at these portents?<br></i><br> Tugging at her braid, Beatrice bites her lip, then smiles when she realizes how closely she&#x2019;s being watched.<br><br> &#x201c;Pleased?&#x201d; Adelaide asks, fishing for the truth she knows Eleanor wants to uncover. <br><br> Beatrice doesn&#x2019;t answer. Nor does she meet the eyes of her companions.<br><br> <i>Distracted or determined, </i>Eleanor wonders. <i>Which is it? <br></i><br> Neither. The girl is mulling over the answer she&#x2019;s received. <i>Yes, </i>she thinks, <i>but when? </i>For weeks she&#x2019;s been ravenous with longing for a stranger she&#x2019;s only seen in her dreams. It isn&#x2019;t love, exactly. How could it be? It&#x2019;s more a relent�less curiosity. She would follow the Stranger any�where. And she has, on many nights, chasing his dark figure through dimly lit corridors and graveyards bathed in moonlight. In the morning she wakes exhausted, wishing she could go back <br> to sleep, desperate to return to the last place she saw him. Even if she could explain her state to her friends, she wouldn&#x2019;t. She&#x2019;s afraid that once she gives voice to her vision, the Stranger will disappear from her mind forever. Whenever she attempts to write an account of her dreams, his voice sounds in her head: <i>Don&#x2019;t break the spell. </i>It leaves her puzzled, intrigued. Are the fay-folk Eleanor so often speaks of the source of these visions? Or do they come from someplace else? The girl has plied herself with many cups of dream tea, offered countless trinkets made of mother-of-pearl and coloured glass in order to persuade the fickle creatures to bring her answers, all to no avail. <i>How long must I continue the chase? </i>At least now (if the humble chestnut is to be believed), she knows she&#x2019;s des�tined to meet the Stranger in the flesh. <i>Even if I don&#x2019;t know the how or why of it.<br></i><br> Picking the chestnut from the pan, she deftly peels the shell from the meat. It&#x2019;s piping hot but she&#x2019;s not concerned with getting burned. She&#x2019;s thinking instead of the Stranger, of how soon she can go to sleep and find him in her dreams. <br><br> Holding the fleshy heart of the nut in the palm of her hand until it cools, she offers it to Perdu. <br><br> &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s a good bird?&#x201d; the raven coos before snatching the treat in his beak. <br><br> &#x201c;What if yes or no isn&#x2019;t enough?&#x201d; Eleanor asks. She wants Beatrice to perform another divi�nation. Maybe then she&#x2019;ll be able to figure out what&#x2019;s on the girl&#x2019;s mind.<br><br> &#x201c;If you need to choose between different situ�ations,&#x201d; Beatrice replies, &#x201c;you must name each chestnut according to your choices, then kiss them for luck before putting them into the fire. The order in which they burst is either the order in which you must address the issues or the way in which things will ultimately come to pass.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Situations, or <i>suitors</i>?&#x201d; Adelaide teases. She&#x2019;s noticed Beatrice growing more preoccupied by the day&#x2014;moving about like a sleepwalker, twirl�ing her hair with absent-minded vigour. She&#x2019;s convinced the girl is having a secret affair. She knows the blush of lust when she sees it. <i>Good for her, </i>she thinks. <i>If only Eleanor would stop worry�ing and leave Beatrice to it.</i></p><h2>The Gutenberg Bible of 1454</h2><p><strong>The Book That Changed the World</strong><br> A complete reprint of the revolutionary Gutenberg Bible<br><br> The printing press has been called the greatest invention of the second millennium. Published in Mainz around 1454, the <strong>Gutenberg Bible</strong> was the <strong>first major Western publication to be printed with movable metal type</strong>, ushering in a whole new age of knowledge distribution through mass-produced books.<br><br> Before Gutenberg, woodcut printing and early forms of movable type printing had been mastered in Asia, but had yet to reach Europe. Instead, each book had to be copied by hand in a long, labor-intensive process. Not only did Gutenberg&#x2019;s innovation of mechanical movable type significantly speed up production without sacrificing quality, it <strong>irreversibly enriched public knowledge</strong>, pioneering mass communication and allowing people to access ideas and participate in discussions like never before. <strong>When it comes to radical revolutions in media, the Gutenberg Bible is up there with the Internet.</strong><br><br> This <strong>fascimile edition</strong> derives from <strong>one of the very few surviving complete vellum Latin originals worldwide; the G�ttingen Library edition</strong>, one of the most valuable books in the world, listed in the <strong>UNESCO Memory of the World program</strong>. All 1,282 pages of this artistic and technological masterwork are included, along with a companion book written by Stephan F�ssel, Gutenberg-Chair at Mainz University, introducing Gutenberg, his transformative influence, and two important documents of the time: the G�ttingen Model Book which was used to illuminate the G�ttingen Library edition and the only surviving notary document by Ulrich Helmasperger, which records the history of this unique invention and its product, the Gutenberg Bible.</p><p>Stephan F�ssel is director of the Institute for Book Studies at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, and holder of the Gutenberg Chair at the same university. He has published prolifically on the early days of printing, the sale and publication of books between the 18th and 20th centuries, and the future of communications.</p><h2>Lola Gets a Cat (Lola Reads)</h2><p>Lola wants a cat, but Mommy says taking care of a pet is a lot of work.

This classic nineteenth-century work on sexual aberration addressed such previously taboo subjects as bestiality, cunnilingus and fellatio, fetishism, incest, masochism, masturbation, nymphomania, and sadism, making it the first serious attempt to catalog and define such deviations.&#x201d;<br><br> For almost one hundred years, <i>Psychopathia Sexualis</i> stood as the world&#x2019;s most informative volume on the subject of sexual deviation. Arguably the most important precursor to Freud in the study of human sexuality, Krafft-Ebing introduced ideas and concepts that greatly influenced the works of Alfred Kinsey and Masters and Johnson. In his own time Krafft-Ebing was both praised and damned for this volume. Some psychiatrists denounced the work as an immoral apology for perversion and deviance, while others recognized the immense service the author had done for an unjustly neglected area of study. Although sometimes dated by the beliefs and state of knowledge of the time it was written, <i>Psychopathia Sexualis</i> is essential (and immensely entertaining) as one of the most important documents in humankind&#x2019;s modern effort to understand itself.</p><p><b>Richard von Krafft-Ebing</b>, a German neurologist, was born in 1840 and died in 1902.

Magliocco examines the roots that this religious movement has in a Western spiritual tradition of mysticism disavowed by the Enlightenment. She explores, too, how modern Pagans and Witches are imaginatively reclaiming discarded practices and beliefs to create religions more in keeping with their personal experience of the world as sacred and filled with meaning. Neo-Pagan religions focus on experience, rather than belief, and many contemporary practitioners have had mystical experiences. They seek a context that normalizes them and creates in them new spiritual dimensions that involve change in ordinary consciousness.</p><p>Magliocco analyzes magical practices and rituals of Neo-Paganism as art forms that reanimate the cosmos and stimulate the imagination of its practitioners. She discusses rituals that are put together using materials from a variety of cultural and historical sources, and examines the cultural politics surrounding the movement&#x2014;how the Neo-Pagan movement creates identity by contrasting itself against the dominant culture and how it can be understood in the context of early twenty-first-century identity politics.</p><p><i>Witching Culture</i> is the first ethnography of this religious movement to focus specifically on the role of anthropology and folklore in its formation, on experiences that are central to its practice, and on what it reveals about identity and belief in twenty-first-century North America.</p></p><p><b>Sabina Magliocco</b> teaches anthropology at California State University, Northridge.<p>"Magliocco impressively corrals the diverse writings and experiences of U.S. neo-pagans into this highly readable and deeply researched ethnographic study. . . .

Was there really an Eleanor Rigby? Where's Penny Lane? In <em>A Hard Day's Write, </em> music journalist Steve Turner shatters many well-worn myths and adds a new dimension to the Fab Four's rich legacy by investigating for the first time the ordinary people and events immortalized in the Beatles' music and now occupying a special niche in popular culture's collective imagination.</p><p> Arranged chronologically by album, the book breaks new ground by exploring how private incidents influenced the group's writing and how their music evolved. Turner reveals that Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was really a drawing by Julian Lennon of his childhood friend; Bungalow Bill was an all-American tiger hunter; Doctor Robert was a New York 'speech doctor'; and much more. A longtime Beatles admirer, Turner tracked down and interviewed the real-life subjects of the songs, probed public records and newspaper archives, and spoke in depth to the people closet to the Beatles to unearth tales that have never before been made public.

A clock appears in the center. It&#x2019;s 12:08 a.m. Seren Locke&#x2019;s birthday party has just ended, and my friends will be posting about it on their way home.<br> &nbsp;<br> I flop back onto my bed. I&#x2019;m not going to look. Only a loser would obsess over a party she missed.<br> &nbsp;<br> For two whole minutes, I stare at the ceiling of my room. Then, with a groan, I give in and poke one of the icons on the screen. A long stream of messages covers my wall. To the left of each message is a photo of the person who posted it. Some of the messages are pictures. Others are short video clips, playing silently because I&#x2019;ve disabled the sound; I don&#x2019;t want to hear about all the fun my friends had without me.<br> &nbsp;<br> My bedroom door slides open with a whisper, startling me, and I swipe my hand at the screen, closing the message stream. The e-glass fogs over, then becomes transparent again, showing the wall behind it, which is painted in subtle stripes of ivory and honey milk. Or, as my fiance describes the colors, white and a little less white.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Knock, knock,&#x201d; my father says from the doorway, though the door is open. I&#x2019;ve set it to let him in but to keep my mother out. Of course, she can override the settings, but the fact that I want to keep her out is enough to make my point.<br> &nbsp;<br> My dad doesn&#x2019;t say anything, but he saw my screen. He knows I was secretly stalking my friends. &#x201c;What, no camera crew today?&#x201d; He glances around my room in mock disbelief as he steps inside, carrying a covered tray.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What would be the point?&#x201d; I get up, and the pink-and-white comforter smooths itself out, leaving a flawless, wrinkle-free finish. &#x201c;Why would the world want to see me sitting here staring at the wall?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He smiles as he sets the tray on my dresser. &#x201c;The world wants to see everything &#x2018;the people&#x2019;s princess&#x2019; does.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I shrug. I have fun playing princess on camera, but my father knows me like my followers and cyberstalkers never will.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You know, we have servants to do that.&#x201d; I lift my chin at the tray.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am aware. But when your daughter already has everything, sometimes the only thing left to give her is a personal touch.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That is so cheesy.&#x201d; I roll my eyes, but I can&#x2019;t hide my smile.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Actually, it&#x2019;s chocolaty.&#x201d; He pulls the lid from the tray, revealing two steaming mugs of something divinely sweet-smelling. &#x201c;Organic Swiss cocoa.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mom&#x2019;s cocoa?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He nods. &#x201c;First shipment of the season.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Okay, yes, it&#x2019;s just hot chocolate. Except that the cocoa beans this chocolate comes from are organically harvested from a farm overseas. Grown in actual dirt and watered by hand. Harvested by hand. Dried and processed by hand. Packaged by hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> All that specialized labor makes the cocoa insanely expensive.<br> &nbsp;<br> My mother has a cup with breakfast every morning.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And . . .&#x201d; My father lifts a smaller dome lid from an opaque glass bowl at the back of the tray. &#x201c;Hand-cut chocolate-hazelnut marshmallows.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Does Mom know you dug into her stash?&#x201d; I take a mug and use a tiny pair of tongs to drop two large, fluffy marshmallows into it. A glance at the thermostat on the side of the mug tells me it&#x2019;s set to keep the contents at perfect sipping temperature.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re celebrating. Let me worry about your mother.&#x201d; My dad picks up his own mug, then settles into my desk chair as I sit on the edge of my bed. &#x201c;I assume you&#x2019;ve seen the ratings?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The second they were posted.&#x201d; I consider a modest shrug, but modesty isn&#x2019;t really my thing. So I give him a huge grin. &#x201c;Highest viewership of a reality show ever recorded. The proposal episode broke the record.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My daughter, the most famous person in the world.&#x201d; He takes a sip. &#x201c;So why aren&#x2019;t you swinging from the chandelier?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I give him a look. He knows exactly why I&#x2019;m sulking. How ridiculous is it that I am the single most valuable asset on network and I&#x2019;m grounded?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Waverly, are you really going to let one missed party overshadow the good news? Why wouldn&#x2019;t she let you go, anyway?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I tuck my legs beneath me on the bed and blow into my mug. &#x201c;I honestly have no idea.&#x201d; My father arches one brow at me, but I talk over his skepticism. &#x201c;No, really. She just said I couldn&#x2019;t go. No reason. She won&#x2019;t even talk about it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s strange.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Normally, my mother is logical to a fault, but . . . &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like she has something against Seren. She grounded me last year on his birthday too.&#x201d; I pluck a marshmallow from my cocoa and bite into it, frowning as I chew. &#x201c;And she dragged us all on vacation during Sofia&#x2019;s birthday party this year, remember? Maybe it&#x2019;s not just Seren she doesn&#x2019;t like, but the whole Locke family. . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re reading a little too much into it,&#x201d; my dad says.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Or maybe it&#x2019;s Seren and Sofia&#x2019;s mother. The Administrator could creep anyone out.&#x201d; I take the first sip from my mug. The cocoa is decadently sweet and creamy. The kind of thing I should be enjoying on camera.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So why is missing this party such a tragedy, anyway? There&#x2019;s still a cyber-blackout at Lakeview, right?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My silent sip tells him more than actually answering would.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ah. That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;What happens in Lakeview stays in Lakeview, right? Because of the blackout.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> There are only two parties a year in Lakeview--Seren&#x2019;s birthday party and Sofia&#x2019;s birthday party--and because the Lakeview compound is a digital dark zone, you can do whatever you want without worrying about video showing up online. While you&#x2019;re there, it&#x2019;s like you don&#x2019;t really exist, except to the other people at the party. It&#x2019;s liberating, in an oddly low-tech way.<br> &nbsp;<br> At least, that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve heard.</p></p><h2>Les Parisiennes: Resistance, Collaboration, and the Women of Paris Under Nazi Occupation</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Anne Sebba has the nearly miraculous gift of combining the vivid intimacy of the lives of women during The Occupation with the history of the time. This is a remarkable book.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Edmund de Waal, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>The Hare with the Amber Eyes</i></b></p><p>In<i> Les Parisiennes</i>,<i> New York Times </i>bestselling author Anne Sebba explores a devastating period in Paris's history and tells the stories of how women survived&#x2015;or didn&#x2019;t&#x2015;during the Nazi occupation.</p><p>Paris in the 1940s was a place of fear, power, aggression, courage, deprivation, and secrets. During the occupation, the swastika flew from the Eiffel Tower and danger lurked on every corner. While Parisian men were either fighting at the front or captured and forced to work in German factories, the women of Paris were left behind where they would come face to face with the German conquerors on a daily basis, as waitresses, shop assistants, or wives and mothers, increasingly desperate to find food to feed their families as hunger became part of everyday life.</p><p>When the Nazis and the puppet Vichy regime began rounding up Jews to ship east to concentration camps, the full horror of the war was brought home and the choice between collaboration and resistance became unavoidable. Sebba focuses on the role of women, many of whom faced life and death decisions every day. After the war ended, there would be a fierce settling of accounts between those who made peace with or, worse, helped the occupiers and those who fought the Nazis in any way they could.</p></p><p>ANNE SEBBA is a biographer, lecturer, and former Reuters foreign correspondent who has written several books, including <i>That Woman: The Life of Wallis Simpson</i>, <i>Duchess of Windsor</i> and is a member of the Society of Authors Executive Committee.

Anna Sebba knows <i>everything</i> about Paris during the war and she relates in <i>Les Parisiennes</i> the end of all the whispered stories I&#x2019;ve been hearing all my life.

Sebba reminds us that we should listen and put ourselves in their shoes, before leaping immediately to judgement, and backs this up with testimonies from many women whose voices have remained unheard.&#x201d; &#x2015;Kate Mosse, Author of <i>Labyrinth</i> and <i>Citadel</i></p><p>&#x201c;Impressive . . .

No Angel is an irresistibly sweeping saga of power, family politics, and passion-a riveting drama and a fervent love story. Celia Lytton is the beautiful and strong-willed daughter of wealthy aristocrats and she is used to getting her way. She moves through life making difficult and often dangerous decisions that affect herself and others-her husband, Oliver, and their children; the destitute Sylvia Miller, whose life is transformed by Celia&#x2019;s intrusion; as well as Oliver&#x2019;s daunting elder sister, who is not all she appears to be; and Sebastian Brooke, for whom Celia makes the most dangerous decision of all. Set against the tumultuous backdrop of London and New York in the First World War, No Angel is, as British Good Housekeeping wrote, &#x201c;an absorbing page-turner, packed with believable characters and satisfyingly extreme villains, eccentrics, and manipulators.&#x201d; Readers of Maeve Binchy, Barbara Taylor Bradford, and Anita Shreve will fall in love with this epic, un-put-downable novel.</p><p><b>Penny Vincenzi</b> has written seventeen bestselling novels, including <i>No Angel, Something Dangerous, Into Temptation, Wicked Pleasures, Another Woman, Forbidden Places, Windfall, An Outrageous Affair, The Dilemma, Almost a Crime, </i>and <i>A Perfect Heritage</i>.

Not to mention huge appreciation for some particularly crucial structural advice.</p><p>Acknowledgements</p><p>As always, a long list of people without whom this book would not have happened. Probably top of the bill should go to my agent Desmond Elliott (no relation to the villain of the piece) for his encyclopaedian knowledge of publishing, after a wonderful lifetime in the business. Stories, anecdotes, facts and figures tumbled down the wires from his office to mine; the book would have been much the poorer without him.</p><p>I owe a big debt too to Rosemary Stark who gave me an extraordinarily insightful view of twin-ness, as did Jo Puccioni.</p><p>I would like to thank Martin Harvey for taking me round the Garrick Club and acquainting me so patiently with its history and its connection with publishing, and Ursula Lloyd who once more guided me through the complexities of medicine in the early part of the century, and Hugh Dickens for an immensely authoritative over-view of military matters.</p><p>For legal and other advice, I owe, as always, huge gratitude to Sue Stapely who either knows whatever I need to, or someone else who does; and to Mark Stephens who adds zest and originality to his fearsome knowledge of libel law and publishing.</p><p>I have delved into some particularly wonderful books for information: most notably <i>Despatches from the Heart</i> by Annette Tapert, <i>In Society: The Brideshead Years</i> by Nicholas Courtney, <i>The Country House Remembered</i> edited by Merlin Watterson, <i>Mrs Keppel and Her Daughter</i> by Diana Souhami and the marvelous <i>Round About a Pound a Week</i> by Maud Pember Reeves. Huge thanks to my four daughters Polly, Sophie, Emily and Claudia who continue to endure my self centered and panicky ramblings as publication draws nearer with kindness and sympathy, never indicating for a moment that they find (as they must do) the annual repetition of the drama rather tedious. I am and always will be immensely grateful to them. And to my husband Paul who has to endure even more of it, and (almost) never indicates it either...</p><p>I owe everybody a great deal. It has, as always, in retrospect anyway, been tremendous fun.</p><p><b><i>Part One</i></b></p><p><b>1904 &#x2013; 1914</b></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Celia stood at the altar, smiling into the face of her bridegroom and wondered if she was about to test his vow to cherish her in sickness and in health rather sooner than he might have imagined. She really did feel as if she was going to vomit: there and then, in front of the congregation, the vicar, the choir. This was truly the stuff of which nightmares were made. She closed her eyes briefly, took a very deep breath, swallowed; heard dimly through her swimmy clammy nausea the vicar saying, &#x2018;I now pronounce you man and wife&#x2019;, and somehow the fact that she had done it, managed this marriage, managed this day, that she was married to Oliver Lytton, whom she loved so much, and that no one could change anything now, made her feel better. She saw Oliver&#x2019;s eyes on her, tender, but slightly anxious, having observed her faintness, and she managed to smile again before sinking gratefully on to her knees for the blessing.</p><p>Not an ideal condition for a bride to be in, almost three months&#x2019; pregnant; but then if she hadn&#x2019;t been pregnant, her father would never have allowed her to marry Oliver anyway. It had been a fairly drastic measure; but it had worked. As she had known it would. And it had certainly been fun: she had enjoyed becoming pregnant a lot.</p><p>The blessing was over now; they were being ushered into the vestry to sign the register. She felt Oliver&#x2019;s hand taking hers, and glanced over her shoulder at the group following them. There were her parents, her father fiercely stern, the old hypocrite: she&#x2019;d grown up seeing pretty housemaid after pretty housemaid banished from the house, her mother, staunchly smiling, Oliver&#x2019;s frail old father, leaning on his cane supported by his sister Margaret, and just behind them, Oliver&#x2019;s two brothers, Robert rather stiff and formal and slightly portly, Jack, the youngest, absurdly handsome, with his brilliant blue eyes restlessly exploring the congregation for any pretty faces. Beyond them were the guests, admittedly rather few, just very close friends and family, and the people from the village and the estate, who of course wouldn&#x2019;t have missed her being married for anything. She knew that in some ways her mother minded about that more than about anything else really, that it wasn&#x2019;t a huge wedding like her sister Caroline&#x2019;s, with three hundred guests at St Margaret&#x2019;s Westminster, but a quiet affair in the village church. Well, she didn&#x2019;t mind. She didn&#x2019;t mind in the very least. She had married Oliver: she had got her way.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&#x2018;Of course you can&#x2019;t marry him,&#x2019; her mother had said, &#x2018;he has no money, no position, no house even, your father won&#x2019;t hear of it.&#x2019;</p><p>Her father did hear about it, about her wish to marry Oliver, because she made him listen; but he reiterated everything her mother had said.</p><p>&#x2018;Ridiculous. Throwing your life away. You want to marry properly, Celia, into your own class, someone who can keep you and support you in a reasonable way.&#x2019;</p><p>She said she did not want to marry properly, she wanted to marry Oliver, because she loved him; that he had a brilliant future, that his father owned a successful publishing house in London which would be his one day.</p><p>&#x2018;Successful, nonsense,&#x2019; her father said, &#x2018;if it was successful he wouldn&#x2019;t be living in Hampstead would he? With nowhere in the country. No, darling,&#x2019; for he adored her, his youngest, a late flower in his life, &#x2018;you find someone suitable and you can get married straight away. That&#x2019;s what you really want, I know, a home and husband and babies; it&#x2019;s natural, I wouldn&#x2019;t dream of stopping you. But it&#x2019;s got to be someone who&#x2019;s right for you. This fellow can&#x2019;t even ride a horse.&#x2019;</p><p>Things had got much worse after that; she had shouted, raged, sworn she would never marry anyone else, and they had shouted and raged back at her, telling her she was being ridiculous, that she had no idea what she was talking about, that she clearly had no idea what marriage was about, that it was a serious matter, a considerable undertaking, not some absurd notion about love.</p><p>&#x2018;Very over-rated, love,&#x2019; her mother said briskly, &#x2018;doesn&#x2019;t last, Celia, not what you&#x2019;re talking about. And when it&#x2019;s gone, you need other things, believe me. Like a decent home to bring up your children in. Marriage is a business and it works best when both parties see it that way.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Celia was just eighteen years old when she met Oliver Lytton: she had looked at him across the room at a luncheon party in London given by a rather bohemian friend of her sister&#x2019;s and fallen helplessly in love with him, even before they had spoken a single word. Afterwards, trying to analyse that sensation, to explain it to herself, she could only feel she had been invaded by an intense emotion, taken hold of, shaken by it; she felt immediately changed, the focus of her life suddenly found. It was primarily an emotional reaction to him, a desire to be with him, close to him in every way, not mere physical attraction which she had experienced to some degree before; he was quite extraordinarily handsome, of course, tall and rather serious, indeed almost solemn-looking, with fair hair, blue eyes, and a glorious smile that entirely changed his face, bringing to it not just a softness, but a merriment, a sense of great joie de vivre.</p><p>But he was more than handsome, he was charming, beautifully mannered, clearly very intelligent, with a great deal more to talk about than most of the young men she had met. Indeed he talked about things she had never heard a young man speak of before, of books and literature, of plays and art exhibitions. He asked her if she had been to Florence and Paris and when she said she had, asked her then which galleries she had most enjoyed and admired. He also &#x2013; which she found more engaging than any of the rest &#x2013; had a way of treating her as if she were as clever and as well-read as he. Celia, who was of a generation and class of girls educated at home by governesses, was entirely charmed by this. She had been brought up in the only way her parents knew and recognised: to marry someone from her own social class, and to lead a life exactly the same as her mother&#x2019;s, raising a family and running a household; from the moment she set eyes on Oliver Lytton, she knew this was not what she wanted.</p><p>She was the youngest daughter of a very old and socially impeccable family. The Beckenhams dated back to the sixteenth century, as her mother, the Countess of Beckenham, was fond of telling everyone; the family had a glorious and quite grand seventeenth century house and estate called Ashingham in Buckinghamshire, not far from Beaconsfield, and a very beautiful town house in Clarges Street, Mayfair. They were extremely rich and concerned only with running their estate, conserving their assets, and enjoying what was mostly a country life. Lord Beckenham ran the home farm, hunted and shot a great deal in the winter, and fished in the summer, Lady Beckenham socialised both in London and the country, rode, played cards, organised her staff, and &#x2013; rather more reluctantly &#x2013; saw to the upkeep of her extensive wardrobe. Books, like pictures, were things which covered the Beckenham walls and were appreciated for their value rather more than for their content; talk at their dinner table centred around their own lives, rather than around abstract matters such as art, literature and philosophy.</p><p>Confronted by a daughter who professed herself &#x2013; after only three months&#x2019; short acquaintance &#x2013; to be in love with someone who, by their standards, was not only a pauper, but almost as unfamiliar to them as a Zulu warrior, they were genuinely appalled and anxious for her.</p><p>Celia could see that they were entirely serious in their opposition; she supposed she could marry Oliver when she was twenty-one, but that was unimaginably far off, three years away. And so, staring into the darkness through her bedroom window late one night, her eyes sore with weeping, wondering what on earth she could do, she had suddenly found it: the solution. The breathtakingly, dazzlingly simple solution. She would become pregnant and then they would <i>have</i> to let her marry him. The more she thought about it, the more sensible it seemed. The only alternative was running away; but Oliver had rejected that sweetly but firmly.</p><p>&#x2018;It would cause too much anxiety, hurt too many people, my family as well as yours. I don&#x2019;t want us to build our life together on other people&#x2019;s unhappiness.&#x2019;</p><p>His gentleness was only one of the many things she loved about him.</p><p>Just the same, she thought that night, he would not accede to this plan too easily. He would argue that pregnancy would also cause great distress; he would not see that they deserved it, her blind, insensitive, hypocritical parents: hardly models of marital virtue themselves, her father with the housemaids, her mother with her lover of many years. Her sister, Caroline had told her about him, the year before, at her own coming out ball at Ashingham. Caroline had had too much champagne and was standing with Celia between dances, looking across at their parents talking animatedly to one another. Celia had said impulsively how sweet it was that they were still so happy together, in spite of the housemaids, and Caroline had said that if they were, much of the credit should go to George Paget. George Paget and his rather plain wife, Vera, were old family friends; pressed to explain precisely what she meant, Caroline said that George had been her mother&#x2019;s lover for over ten years. Half shocked, half fascinated, Celia begged to be told more, but Caroline laughed at her for being so innocent and launched herelf on to the dance floor with her husband&#x2019;s best friend. But next day she had relented, remorseful at disillusioning her little sister, said she mustn&#x2019;t worry about it, that it wasn&#x2019;t important.</p><p>&#x2018;Mama will always keep the rules.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What rules?&#x2019; Celia said.</p><p>&#x2018;Society&#x2019;s rules,&#x2019; said Caroline, patiently reassuring. &#x2018;Discretion, manners, those sorts of things. She would never leave Papa. To them marriage is unshakable. What they do, what all society does, is make marriage more pleasant, more interesting. Stronger, actually, I would say.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And &#x2013; would &#x2013; would you make your marriage more pleasant in that way?&#x2019; Celia asked and Caroline laughed and said that at the moment, hers was fairly pleasant anyway.</p><p>&#x2018;But yes, I suppose I would. If Arthur became dull, or found pleasure of his own elsewhere. Don&#x2019;t look so shocked, Celia, you really are an innocent aren&#x2019;t you? I heard it said the other day that Mrs Keppel, you know, the king&#x2019;s mistress, has turned adultery into an art form. That seems quite a nice achievement to me.&#x2019;</p><p>Celia had still felt shocked, despite the reassurance. When she got married, she knew it would be for love and for life.</p><p>So &#x2013; Oliver must not realise the full exte...</p></p><h2>Fall in Line, Holden!</h2><p>&#x201c;Fall in Line, Holden!&#x201d; tells the story of a young Navajo student named Holden as he venture&#x2019;s through boarding school while constantly being told to &#x201c;fall in line&#x201d;.

This book is an essential guide to the Anglican tradition for anyone who has ever wondered what Anglicanism-the largest Protestant denomination in the world-is all about. Now fully updated and significantly revised, this second edition of Our Anglican Heritage gives voice to the strong and vibrant evangelical roots of Anglican Christianity. Events at the start of the twenty-first century have threatened to tear the Communion apart. The authors of this book, both Episcopal clergy, each responded to the crisis in different ways. One, a bishop, chose to stay in the Episcopal Church. The other chose to lead his congregation out of the Episcopal Church and into another Anglican Province. This book is a reflection of the strong faith and heritage they still share, and a recommitment to the biblical principles that still undergird and enliven Anglicanism.</p><p>The Rt Revd and Rt Hon.

They will celebrate their good fortune by racing motorcars they beg, borrow, or own from Paris to Nice.</p><p>In November 1919, the officers all meet as planned, and though their motorcars are not designed for racing, they set out for Nice. But a serious mishap mars the reunion. In the mountains just north of their destination, two vehicles are nearly run off the road, and one man is badly injured. No one knows&#x2014;or will admit to knowing&#x2014;which driver was at the wheel of the rogue motorcar.</p><p>Back in England one year later, during a heavy rainstorm, a driver loses control on a twisting road and is killed in the crash. Was it an accident due to the hazardous conditions? Or premeditated murder? Is the crash connected in some way to the unfortunate events in the mountains above Nice the year before? The dead driver wasn&#x2019;t in France&#x2014;although the motorcar he drove was. If it was foul play, was it a case of mistaken identity? Or was the dead man the intended victim after all?</p><p>Investigating this perplexing case, Scotland Yard Inspector Ian Rutledge discovers that the truth is elusive&#x2014;and that the villages on the South Downs, where the accident happened, are adept at keeping secrets, frustrating his search. Determined to remain in the shadows this faceless killer is willing to strike again to stop Rutledge from finding him. This time, the victim he chooses is a child, and it will take all of Rutledge&#x2019;s skill to stop him before an innocent young life is sacrificed.</p></p><p><p>In late June 1916, before the bloody Battle of the Somme, several English officers have a last drink before returning to the Front. Besides the war, they also have a passion for motorcars in common. Daring fate, they swear to meet in Paris a year after the war ends to celebrate their survival by racing motorcars from Paris to Nice.</p><p>In November 1919, five remaining officers set out for Nice.

Author Dusti Bowling (<i>Insignificant Events in the Life of a Cactus</i>) returns to the desert to create a gripping story about friendship, hope, and finding the power we all have within ourselves.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Welcome to Nowhere, Arizona, the least livable town in the United States. For Gus, a bright 13-year-old with dreams of getting out and going to college, life there is made even worse by Bo Taylor, Nowhere&#x2019;s biggest, baddest bully. When Bo tries to force Gus to eat a dangerously spiny cactus, Rossi Scott, one of the best racers in Nowhere, comes to his rescue&#x2014;but in return she has to give Bo her prized dirt bike. Determined to buy it back, Gus agrees to go searching for gold in Dead Frenchman Mine, joined by his old friends Jessie Navarro and Matthew Dufort, and Rossi herself. As they hunt for treasure, narrowly surviving everything from cave-ins to mountain lions, they bond over shared stories of how hard life in Nowhere is&#x2014;and they realize this adventure just may be their way out.</p><p>Dusti Bowling holds a Bachelor of Psychology and a Master of Education, but eventually realized that her true passion was writing. The author of the IndieNext pick <i>Insignificant Events in the Life of a Cactus, </i>she currently lives in with her husband, three daughters, one bobcat, a pack of coyotes, a couple of chuckwallas, several rattlesnakes, and a few herds of javelina.&#x201c;Thirteen-year-old Gus is a white boy from Nowhere. Literally. Nowhere, AZ: population depressed, poverty-stricken, and stagnant. Dirt bike racing is the only blip on the town&#x2019;s flat-lining pulse. Gus is smart, but his small size makes him a natural target for Bo, the town bully. When Rossi, a Tohono O&#x2019;odham girl with a talent for racing, stands up for Gus, she loses her beloved bike to Bo. Gus vows to get it back for her. Bo&#x2019;s terms require Gus to enter a closed mine with a history of collapses and find gold rumored to have been lost decades ago. Gus agrees and is joined by one of Bo&#x2019;s minions, an old friend, and Rossi. Each an outcast in some way, the kids form a bond through their harrowing 24-hour adventure. This allows each to gain strength from the others and push on. Conversations among the young teens reveal Gus&#x2019;s burgeoning awareness of his white privilege as he listens to the experiences of his Latinx and Native American friends. This story features wonderfully funny, surprising characters with witty, realistic dialogue. Friendships are forged, lives are changed, and mysteries are solved. VERDICT Reminiscent of Louis Sachar&#x2019;s <i>Holes</i> with its quirky characters and unique desert setting, this is a middle-grade read that will easily transport readers somewhere special.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>School Library Journal </i>(Starred review)<br><br> &#x201c;Short, smart Gus is regularly tormented by Bo, a &#x2018;thirteen-year-old in the body of an eighteen-year-old with the mind of an eight-year-old.&#x2019; In their hot, dry, rundown town of Nowhere, Arizona, kids like Gus who don't race dirt bikes are, socially speaking, the lowest of the low. So, it is the highest sacrifice when the best dirt bike racer in town, Rossi, a citizen of the Tohono O'odham tribe, offers her beloved bike to Bo to save Gus. Determined to make things right by her, Gus agrees to Bo's ridiculous demand for a piece of gold from the collapsing mine outside town in exchange for the bike. In no time, Gus, Rossi and two former friends who have unexpectedly joined the foolhardy expedition get lost in a mine, trapped in a cave-in, attacked by wild animals and nearly drown in a mysterious underground lake with skeletons and &#x2018;strange mutant albino shrimp.&#x2019; They're also coming to terms with the idea that even if their ancestors were murderous, mortal enemies&#x2014;which, well, they were&#x2014;the kids don't need to carry on the feuding tradition. Readers who loved Holes and Dusti Bowling's earlier novel, Insignificant Events in the Life of a Cactus, will be delighted with 24 Hours in Nowhere, a similarly captivating novel abounding in wordplay, eccentric personalities and an evocative setting: &#x2018;Nowhere was the best at a lot of things: number one in poverty, number one in high school dropouts, number one in least livability, number one in drunken mine deaths. We tried not to let it all go to our heads.&#x2019; Maybe they should. Discover: In this funny, moving novel, four teens explore an abandoned gold mine in order to placate their town's resident bully, making discoveries about the past&#x2014;and themselves&#x2014;along the way.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Shelf Awareness</i>, Starred review<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A blend of taut suspense and laugh-out-loud humor from Bowling (Insignificant Events in the Life of a Cactus) proves a winning combination in this 24-hour escapade set in Nowhere, &#x2018;the poorest town in Arizona.&#x2019; Thirteen-year-old Gus wants to leave Nowhere for more than one reason, but high on the list is muscular bully Bo, &#x2018;a mean, ugly giant with blond hair and pork-and-beans-sprinkled-with-chewing-tobacco breath.&#x2019; When Bo tries to force Gus to eat a cactus, classmate Rossi saves the day by giving Bo her beloved dirt bike in exchange for Gus&#x2019;s freedom. Gus is determined to get the bike back, but Bo demands a piece of gold from dangerous Dead Frenchman Mine as ransom. Accompanied by Rossi, childhood friend Jessie, and one of Bo&#x2019;s minions, Gus embarks on the quest, uncovering secrets from the past and falling into many precarious situations, including a run-in with a mountain lion. With playful elements reminiscent of Richard Peck, this slightly larger-than-life adventure offers plentiful surprises and a lovable antihero.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, Starred review<br><br> &#x201c;Nowhere, Arizona, is notorious for being the least livable town in the U.S., and it certainly feels that way for 13-year-old Gus.

But in the time between now and then, to repay the girl who saved his butt, he goes searching for the gold that&#x2019;s supposedly buried deep in Dead Frenchman Mine. The ragtag band of misfits that join him calls to mind the gang from The Goonies, and their underground escapades vacillate among genuinely creepy, hilarious, and thrilling.

Soon after my birth I lived in Williamston, Michigan and then moved onto my grandparents farm in Union City, Michigan.<p>"I lived on the farm with my mom and Grandparents until 1949. That is when my Babushka (my grandmother) died and we prepared to move away from Michigan. I must say that living on that little farm with them was the most magical time of my life...and that my Babushka and other grandparents were some of the most inspirational people in my life.</p><p>"My parents were divorced when I was 3, and both my father and mother moved back into the homes of their parents. I spent the school year with my mother, and the summers with my dad. In both households I was the apple of my grandparents' eyes! I would say that these relationships with my grandparents have most definitely influenced my life and my work. You probably have noticed that in almost every book that I write there is a very young person who is interacting with an elderly person. Personally, I feel that this is the most valuable experience of my life....having the wonder of knowing both children and elderly people.</p><p>"The respect that I learned as a very young person certainly carried over into my life in later years. I have always like hearing stories from these folks. My genuine curiosity for the wonder of living a very long life prepared me to accept the declining years of my own parents.</p><p>"To get back to the farm in Union City...this place was so magical to me that I have never forgotten it! This was the place where I heard such wonderful stories told...this was the place that a real meteor fell into our font yard...that very meteorite is now our family headstone in the graveyard here in Union City.</p><p>"Did I tell you that I now live in Union City? This is after living in Oakland, California for almost 37 years. But, you see, every year I'd come back to Michigan to see my Dad and family.</p><p>"Anyway...</p><p>"In 1949 we left the farm to move, first to Coral Gables, Florida. I lived there with my Mom and my brother, Richard, for almost 3 years. Then we moved to Oakland, California. I remained there for most of my young life on into my adulthood. We lived on Ocean View Drive in the Rockridge District. What I loved the most about this neighborhood is that all of my neighbors came in as many colors, ideas and religions as there are people on the planet. How lucky I was to know so many people that were so different and yet so much alike.</p><p>"It is on Ocean View that I met my best friend, Stewart Grinnell Washington. We are best friends to this day! He has a younger brother, Winston and three sisters; Jackie, Terry and Robin. When I was a student in elementary school I wasn't a very good student. I had a terrible time with reading and math. As a matter of fact, I did not learn how to read until I was almost 14 years old. Can you imagine what it was like to see all my friends do so well in school and I wasn't! I thought I was dumb. I didn't like school because there was this boy that always teased me and made me feel even dumber. When I was fourteen, it was learned that I have a learning disability. It is called dyslexia. I felt trapped in a body that wouldn't do what everybody else could do. That was when one of my hero's, my teacher, found what was wrong with me and got me the help I needed to succeed in school. Of course, now that I am an adult, I realize that being learning disabled does not mean DUMB AT ALL! As a matter of fact, I have learned that being learning disabled only means that I cannot learn the way most of you do. As a matter of fact, most learning disabled children are actually GENIUSES! Once I learned how to read and caught up with the rest of my fellow students, I did very well.</p><p>"I went on to University, majored in Fine Art, then went on to do a graduate degree and even ended up with a Ph.D. in Art History. For a time I restored ancient pieces of art for museums. I eventually became the mother of two children, Steven and Traci, and devoted much of my days to their education and upbringing.</p><p>"I did not start writing children's books until I was 41 years old. Mind you the "art" has always been there for me most of my life. Apparently one of the symptoms of my disability in academics is the ability of draw very, very well. So drawing, painting and sculpture has always been a part of my life even before I started illustrating my books. The books were quite a surprise, really. Mind you, I came from a family of incredible storytellers. My mother's people were from the Ukraine and Russia...my father's people were from Ireland. My extended family,(Stewart's family) were from the bayous of Louisiana...also great story tellers. When you are raised on HEARING stories.....NOT SEEING THEM, you become very good at telling stories yourself. So at the age of 41 I started putting stories that I told down on paper and did drawings to help illustrate them...I guess the rest is history.</p><p>"I have enjoyed a wonderful career of writing books for children . Who could have guessed that little girl that was having such a tough time in school would end up an illustrator and author. Children and adults alike ask me where I get my ideas...I get them from the same place that you do....MY IMAGINATION... I would guess the reason my imagination is so fertile is because I came from storytelling and, WE DID NOT OWN A T.V.!!!!!!!!! You see, when one is a writer, actor, dancer, musician; a creator of any kind, he or she does these things because they listen to that "voice" inside of them. All of us have that "voice". It is where all inspired thoughts come from....but when you have electronic screens in front, of you, speaking that voice for you... it DROWNS OUT THE VOICE! When I talk to children and aspiring writers, I always ask them to listen to the voice, turn off the T.V. and</p><p>"LISTEN...LISTEN...LISTEN.</p><p>"Now that I have moved back to Union City I am intending to open my house and community and invite people to come there to take part in writing seminars, story telling festivals, literature conferences and various events that celebrate children's literature."</p><p>Born Patricia Ann Barber in Lansing, Michigan, to parents of Russian and Ukrainian descent on one side and Irish on the other, Patricia Polacco grew up in both California and Michigan. Her school year was spent in Oakland, California, and summers in her beloved Michigan. She describes her family members as marvelous storytellers. "My fondest memories are of sitting around a stove or open fire, eating apples and popping corn while listening to the old ones tell glorious stories about their homeland and the past. We are tenacious traditionalists and sentimentalists.... With each retelling our stories gain a little more Umph!"</p><p>Studying in the United States and Australia, Patricia Polacco has earned an M.F.A. and a Ph. D. in art history, specializing in Russian and Greek painting, and iconographic history. She is a museum consultant on the restoration of icons. As a participant in many citizen exchange programs for writers and illustrators, Patricia Polacco has traveled extensively in Russia as well as other former Soviet republics.

What does science tell us about the plausibility of a god? Can we trust the alleged eyewitness testimony of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus? These questions are worth investigating in order to find an answer solidified in fact and evidence. Mark Lanier, one of America's top trial lawyers, uses his experienced legal eye to examine the plausibility of the Christian faith. Bringing science, current knowledge, and common sense together in a courtroom approach, this "trial" elucidates a rich understanding of God and a strong foundation for Christian faith. Following the format of a traditional legal trial, Lanier takes us from opening statement to closing summation by way of testimony from well-known witnesses&#x2015;the scientist, the theologian, the linguist, the humanist, the philosopher, the psychologist and the ancient biblical eye-witness. These sources and many others investigate the sticky subjects of the Christian worldview that are commonly scrutinized by skeptics or overlooked by marginal believers: <ul><li>Who is God in light of astronomical and subatomic science? </li><li>How could divine inspiration of Scripture or Christ?s bodily resurrection be possible?</li><li>How should we see the nature of reality, free will and choice, ethics, morality and the idea of heaven and afterlife? </li></ul> Lanier presents a persuasive case for the Christian faith and leaves it up to us to choose what is worthy of belief and what is not. <em>Christianity on Trial</em> provides a thought-provoking starting point in the search for truth.</p><p>W. Mark Lanier is a trial lawyer and founder of the Lanier Law Firm. <em>U.S. News and World Report's Best Lawyers</em> named him to its Best Lawyers in America list for nine consecutive years and as the 2013 Top Class Action Attorney in America. His courtroom work has been featured in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and <em>The New York Times,</em> and he is a frequent guest on CNBC and Fox Business News. He is the founder of the Lanier Theological Library and teaches biblical literacy at Champion Forest Baptist Church in Houston, Texas."It does a respectable job presenting a few fundamental arguments on topics such as the nature of God, prayer, the Bible, morality, truth, free will and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. . . . This book will be of interest to Christians looking for a few basic starting points to explaining and understanding their faith." (Brian Sullivan, Library Journal, June 15, 2014)<br><br>"W. Mark Lanier's <em>Christianity on Trial</em> is a good book to give to the lawyer who has everything except the belief that alone makes those things significant." (Marvin Olasky, World Magazine, October 18, 2014)<br><br>"Authored by one of the nation's leading trial lawyers, <em>Christianity on Trial</em> brilliantly employs the truth-finding methods of the legal process to produce an eminently readable, highly persuasive work of Christian apologetics. This is an extraordinary trial lawyer's version of <em>Mere Christianity.</em> In his inimitable fashion, Mark Lanier combines his superb expertise as a courtroom lawyer with profound knowledge of biblical scholarship and thoughtful reflection on daily life. Fearless in tackling the most difficult matters of belief, this engaging book speaks to all those interested in seeking truth&#x2015;whether in the courtroom, in the library or in everyday life." (Ken Starr, president, Baylor University)<br><br>"Mark Lanier has probably read more about the Bible than many biblical scholars and combines this with his experience as a leading trial lawyer. The result is a gripping read and a compelling case for Christianity. He touches on so many different kinds of argument that there is something for everyone in this feast." (Peter Williams, warden, Tyndale House, Cambridge, United Kingdom)<br><br>"Because Mark Lanier is my Sunday school teacher, I have the joy of following his teaching week by week no matter where I am in the world. I eventually print out every lesson for my own reference because he is the quintessential teacher, using every means to invest his discerning exposition and wonderful insights into those of us who follow his teaching. I look forward to this volume not only for my personal edification but also as a book that I can place in the hands of those seeking to know Christ in a personal way and to grow in the Christian faith." (Dorothy Kelley Patterson, professor of theology in women's studies, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Fort Worth, Texas)<br><br>"Mark Lanier has made a successful career at seeking out and defending truth in the arena of the American legal system.

Upon arrival in Mexico, they were grouped together and categorized as chinos. Their experience illustrates the interconnectedness of Spain&#39;s colonies and the reach of the crown, which brought people together from Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe in a historically unprecedented way. In time, chinos in Mexico came to be treated under the law as Indians, becoming indigenous vassals of the Spanish crown after 1672. The implications of this legal change were enormous: as Indians, rather than chinos, they could no longer be held as slaves. Tatiana Seijas tracks chinos&#39; complex journey from the slave market in Manila to the streets of Mexico City, and from bondage to liberty. In doing so, she challenges commonly held assumptions about the uniformity of the slave experience in the Americas.</p><p>This book tracks the complex history of Asian slaves who journeyed to Mexico on the ships of the Manila Galleon in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

These pedagogical frameworks guide teachers in planning and implementing instruction. Established approaches to teaching general music must be understood, critically examined, and possibly re-imagined for their potential in school and community music education programs. <br><em>Teaching General Music</em> brings together the top scholars and practitioners in general music education to create a panoramic view of general music pedagogy and to provide critical lenses through which to view these frameworks. The collection includes an examination of the most prevalent approaches to teaching general music, including Dalcroze, Informal Learning, Interdisciplinary, Kod�ly, Music Learning Theory, Orff Schulwerk, Social Constructivism, and World Music Pedagogy. In addition, it provides critical analyses of general music and teaching systems, in light of the ways children around the world experience music in their lives. Rather than promoting or advocating for any single approach to teaching music, this book presents the various approaches in conversation with one another. Highlighting the perceived and documented benefits, limits, challenges, and potentials of each, <em>Teaching</em> <em>General</em> <em>Music</em> offers myriad lenses through which to re-read, re-think, and re-practice these approaches.<br></p><p><br>Carlos R.

Dayton-Hudson even had to take out advertising around town to apologize for changing the Field&#39;s hallowed green bags. And with good reason--the store and those who ran it shaped the city&#39;s streets, subsidized its culture and heralded its progress. The resulting commercial empire dictated wholesale trade terms in Calcutta and sponsored towns in North Carolina, but its essence was always Chicago. So when the Marshall Field name was retired in 2006 after the stores were purchased by Macy&#39;s, protest slogans like &#34;Field&#39;s is Chicago&#34; and &#34;Field&#39;s: as Chicago as it gets&#34; weren&#39;t just emotional hype. Many still hope that name will be resurrected like the city it helped support during the Great Fire and the Great Depression. Until then, fans of Marshall Field&#39;s can celebrate its history with this warm look back at the beloved institution.</p><p>Gayle Soucek is an author and freelance editor with several books and numerous magazine articles to her credit.

As any modern da Vinci student knows, Leonardo's notebook both served as the incubator and repository of his unique genius and provides the foundation of any modern-day student's attempt to emulate that genius on his own. From the very first exercise in the original <b>How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci</b>, Gelb encourages readers to keep their own personal notebooks in which to hone their da Vincian skills; now he provides that notebook for them, with the added bonus of tips on exercises they'll recognize and new suggestions and assignments that will build on the work they've already done.<br><br>Designed to echo the inviting look of <b>How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci</b>, and structured to help readers focus on each of the seven genius principles, <b>The How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci Workbook</b> is a companion volume that truly complements and enhances the reader's experience of the original book on which it's based.</p><p>Leonardo da Vinci is the perfect antidote to a dumbed-down world. Perfect for anyone with similar aspirations for self-actualization, the exercises in <i>The How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci Workbook</i> are designed to provide a lifetime of cerebral expansion, using the seven parameters laid out in <i>How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci</i>: curiosity; developing knowledge though experience; sensual refinement; a willingness to embrace ambiguity and paradox; linking the scientific and creative sides of the brain; physical poise and fitness; and understanding the connectedness of all life.<p> For example, to develop curiosity, one of the exercises has you ask people you respect to assess your strengths and weaknesses and to offer ways in which you could improve. Uncomfortable? Probably, for both parties. But if you're not curious about how others perceive you, you've closed off entire corridors leading toward self-knowledge and self-improvement. In the section on knowledge and experience, Gelb has you write down each new word you come across, along with its definition, and practice using it as often as you can. Da Vinci, he says, recorded 9,000 words this way. As Gelb notes in his introduction, this isn't a book that can be fully used up in a week or even a year; it could take 10 years to perform all these exercises. It would take months just to listen to the 10 greatest pieces of classical music he lists in the section on sensual refinement, and then listen to them played by different orchestras and conductors to distinguish subtle differences in interpretation. And, certainly, the simmeringly sensual recipes listed in that same section could lead to some very cozy evenings over the course of a lifetime. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p><b>Michael J.

He served in Vietnam with the LRPs of the 101st Airborne Division, earning two Silver Stars, the Bronze Star with V device (for valor), the Army Commendation Medal with V device, and two Purple Hearts.B-52 (Project Delta), 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne)<br> &nbsp;<br> Many of the standard operating procedures employed by long-range reconnaissance patrols during the Vietnam War were established by the men of Project Delta. The program started in May 1964 as an outgrowth of an earlier, covert operation known as Project Leaping Lena. Project Delta grew quickly from a single twelve-man A detachment to a battalion-size command containing nearly one hundred Special Forces personnel and more than twelve hundred indigenous soldiers.<br> &nbsp;<br> B-52 was organized into twelve recon teams, twelve CIDG &#x201c;roadrunner&#x201d; teams, a Chinese Nung camp security company, and a South Vietnamese Airborne Ranger battalion as a reaction force. Their primary mission was to infiltrate hostile territories inaccessible to conventional units. Project Delta teams went into these areas to locate enemy units, gather intelligence, ambush small enemy elements, coordinate air and artillery strikes, perform bomb-damage assessments, harass and confuse the enemy, and sometimes to conduct special-purpose raids. It was because of the success of Project Delta that Gen. William Westmoreland decided to authorize the formation and utilization of special reconnaissance elements for the conventional army forces deploying to Vietnam. So he sent a directive to 5th Special Forces Group to establish a permanent three-week-long school based on the concepts developed by Project Delta. He named the school &#x201c;Recondo&#x201d; after three well-known terms associated with soldiering&#x2014; reconnaissance, commando, and doughboy. It was the beginning of a rich history of long-range patrolling carried out during the Vietnam War.<br> &nbsp;<br> By November 1965, the guerrilla war in South Vietnam had taken on a new face. Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap&#x2019;s regular North Vietnamese Army divisions had surreptitiously infiltrated into the country and were openly challenging the American and South Vietnamese divisions on numerous battlefields from the DMZ in the north to the Delta in the south. Conventional unit commanders who had been used to dealing with local VC guerrillas and the more organized VC Main Force units began to meet conventional NVA forces that demonstrated a growing propensity to stand toe-to-toe and duke it out. To be able to anticipate such confrontations, major unit commanders were begging for battlefield intelligence from beyond the range of their artillery fans. It was the assembly call for covert U.S. long-range reconnaissance patrols.<br> &nbsp;<br> B-52 (Project Delta), 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), based at Nha Trang, fielded small recon teams, usually two Americans and two indigenous personnel, which worked wherever they were needed in South Vietnam and sometimes, across the border into Laos. In 1965, they were commanded by the legendary Lt. Col. Charles Beckwith.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just before Christmas, 1965, S.Sgt. Brook Bell&#x2019;s patrol, consisting of Sgt. Charles McDonald at point, Quan, a Chinese Nung, and 1st Lt. Guy H. Holland II, received a warning order for a patrol into a mountainous area along the coast north of Vung Tau. The team was told to prepare for a two-day patrol, but little additional information was provided by the infantry division assigned responsibility for that area.<br> &nbsp;<br> After the team went through all the usual preparations for the mission, the men loaded aboard a waiting helicopter late that afternoon. As the Huey approached the LZ, the pilot, flying at treetop height, inadvertently passed too close to a village along a nearby coastal road then faked an insertion into a large clearing not far away. He immediately compounded the error by flying a little farther north before inserting the team. The sun was just setting behind the rugged mountains to the west, and deep shadows darkened the LZ. The large, grassy clearing was well situated on level ground that dropped on one side into a low, heavily timbered thicket at the bottom of the slope. On the far side of the timbered thicket, the ground rose slightly before leveling off again at a somewhat higher elevation than the LZ. Then it ran back away from the LZ until it crossed the road near the village.<br> &nbsp;<br> The chopper flared to a hover over the clearing, far from the nearest tree line, leaving the men a long sprint across the open before they reached cover. As the Huey lifted back into the evening sky, McDonald the point man, headed for the closest tree line. At the edge of the woods, outside the trees, McDonald discovered a well-worn trail. Stepping back into the grass, he motioned for the team to go down, in column. There they lay dog, listening and watching. Ten minutes after the last sounds of the Huey faded in the distance, Bell signaled for McDonald to move on, and the four men were up running again, crossing the trail in single file.<br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t long before McDonald happened across a large thicket in the forest. They were only three hundred meters from their insertion point, but it was getting too dark to move about in the jungle. Taking a quick look around he dropped down on all fours and crawled into the dense cover, his three teammates right behind him. Inside, the brush opened up into a small, circular clearing perfect for the team&#x2019;s first &#x201c;remain overnight&#x201d; (RON). The surface was covered with a thick layer of dry leaves that protected the patrol from the damp floor of the jungle.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once safely inside the thicket, Bell called the command-and-control (C &amp; C) aircraft, circling a few miles away, and reported that they had gotten in safely. Bell then released the aircraft to return to base. The team was on its own, without commo or a link to the outside until 0730 the next morning, the time of the team&#x2019;s next regularly scheduled contact&#x2014; unless something out of the ordinary happened during the night. The four recon men silently cleared their RON of sticks and debris, anything that might make an out-of-place sound and give their location away. Then they sat back quietly in the dark, waiting, watching, and listening over their back trail. If trouble came, it would be from that direction.<br> &nbsp;<br> At 2130 hours, McDonald was on watch when he sensed that something was wrong; the sounds of the night insects had stopped and in the distance, he could hear the faint barking of an animal. He was not alarmed at first, because the Asian barking deer was common to the jungles of that region. However, a few minutes later the barking was closer to their position. Then McDonald realized that the barking was not that of the diminutive deer of Indochina but that of dogs&#x2014; several dogs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ever so quietly, McDonald reached over and gently grabbed Bell&#x2019;s shoulder. When he was certain that his team leader was awake, he leaned to his right and whispered that company was coming. Bell sat up and listened for a minute or two, then whispered to his point man, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like the sounds of that either, but I hope you&#x2019;re wrong.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A large number of dogs barking had to mean that something was going on back at the village. Maybe the local VC had heard the helicopter drop off the team. If they had it would take them a little while to organize a search party. The activity of doing so would have surely upset the dogs in the village. If that was the case, McDonald and Bell knew that it would be only a matter of time before the enemy came looking for whomever had gotten off that helicopter.<br> It was 2200 hours, nearly twenty minutes since the two Delta men had heard the dogs. They were both tense and alert, neither willing to go back to sleep. They had decided to forgo much-needed sleep for the sake of caution.<br> &nbsp;<br> An hour before midnight, something rustled leaves along the trail. The sound was coming from the west, from the direction of the village and the barking dogs, and it was growing louder. Suddenly, through the thick vegetation, they spotted a tiny beam of light sweeping back and forth over the ground. The enemy was definitely looking for them.<br> &nbsp;<br> The next few minutes passed slowly, and then they clearly heard the sounds of metal clanging together and of men talking in hushed tones.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bell carefully reached out to touch Quan and Holland who by then were wide awake. He wanted to assure them that he was aware of the threat. Bell knew that since no one on the team had gone on patrol together before, performance doubts were building inside each one of them. Staying cool was critical to their survival. Fortunately, the enemy soldiers moved past their position and disappeared in the night.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was midnight, and the moon was up high overhead casting a faint illumination through the trees. Out on the trail, it was bright enough to make out forms and shapes. No one seemed to be there, but it wasn&#x2019;t long before the recon team again heard the unmistakable sounds of a number of people on the trail. They could even make out the shadows of men standing between them and the clearing. Without warning, the enemy soldiers began firing their weapons on semiautomatic into the jungle to scare the team into returning fire and giving away their positions.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the remainder of the night, at least a platoon of enemy soldiers working in small groups passed by every thirty to sixty minutes. It was certain that they had no clear idea where the American patrol was hidden, and to stomp through the jungle at night in hopes of stumbling over them was a dangerous gambit they were unwilling to take. But come morning&#x2014;and light&#x2014;the odds of locating the patrol would improve.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bell decided to keep his team hidden in the thicket. To move out of their cover at night during a full moon would only give away their position. And getting hit at night would result in a long and dangerous escape and evasion (E &amp; E) or a battle against insurmountable odds. And there was no chance for help until daylight and the return of the C &amp; C aircraft.<br> &nbsp;<br> The moon set in the last full hour before dawn. But soon the false dawn (BMNT, &#x201c;before morning nautical twilight&#x201d;) began faintly illuminating the jungle around the patrol&#x2019;s position. This was the time that the recon men had fearfully anticipated during the long, dark night. The enemy had not given up and returned to their base camp but were probably waiting in a number of locations for the team to move. If the Americans failed to expose themselves by some predetermined time, the enemy would regroup and sweep the area.<br> &nbsp;<br> The team members would have to break out of the trap, for to stay where they were was to risk discovery, and to be discovered was to die. They had to get free and escape.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>365 Goddess: A Daily Guide to the Magic and Inspiration of the Goddess</h2><p><p>Goddess wisdom for every day of the year</p><p>Bring life-affirming magic and empowerment into every day of your life with this unique and useful guide to the goddess.

What Captain William Rutherford told his seven-year-old son Michael was to stay with him all his life. Born in 1950, Michael was truly his father&#39;s son, even serving in the naval section of the student cadet corps at one of England&#39;s top public schools, Charterhouse. Mike&#39;s future lay in the civil service: it was a subject that he discussed with his father at Captain Crawford&#39;s gentlemen&#39;s club. But then something happened. Mike discovered rock music. As one of the founder members of Genesis, Mike was to tour the world and achieve international fame. From unpromising beginnings - demonised by his teachers as a fomenter of revolution, driving to gigs in a bread van - Mike would go on to crisscross the globe with bandmates Peter Gabriel and, later, Phil Collins, playing to packed-out stadiums and achieving record sales of over 150 million. Swapping old school ties and Savile Row suits for flares and Afghan coats, Mike and Genesis would pioneer the pomp and theatricality of 1970s progressive rock before becoming household names in the 1980s with hits like Turn It On Again, Mama and Land of Confusion. There was drink, there were drugs; there were arguments and excess. But, in the background - and sometimes in the audience - there was also the loyal Captain Rutherford, earplugs at the ready, Melody Maker in hand. A proud father still. The Living Years spans the entire history of Genesis, from the earliest days as a school band to the triumphant 2007 reunion tour when Genesis played to over 500,000 people in Rome.

Rutherford often played rhythm guitar and 12-string guitar for the band in the early years. Following the departure of Steve Hackett from Genesis in 1977, he assumed the role of lead guitarist on the band&#39;s studio albums, beginning with And Then There Were Three in 1978. He is one of only two constant members in Genesis (the other is keyboardist Tony Banks). Rutherford wrote the lyrics to many Genesis songs during their career, including some of the band&#39;s biggest international hits, such as &#34;Follow You, Follow Me&#34;, &#34;Turn It On Again&#34;, &#34;Land of Confusion&#34; and &#34;Throwing It All Away&#34;. He also formed Mike + The Mechanics in 1985. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010.A brisk, wryly humorous trawl through his life in music...

Mail on Sunday Rutherford tells the story of his mildly subversive schooldays and the 40 years of his high-flying career in a mellow, forgiving style that celebrates love of family, loyalty to friendship, passion for music, and-in his father&#39;s tradition -devotion to duty.

They are his disciples, sons, daughters and friends. But it is perhaps too little recognized that they are also his slaves. In this New Studies in Biblical Theology volume, Murray J. Harris sets out to uncover what it means to be a slave of Christ. He begins by assessing the nature of actual slavery in the Greco-Roman world and the New Testament's attitude towards it. Drawing insights from this, he goes on to unfold the metaphor of slavery to Christ. Among the topics discussed are slavery and spiritual freedom, lordship, ownership, and privilege. <em>Slave of Christ</em> is a model of good biblical theology, providing insights both for future study of the Bible and for practical application. Addressing key issues in biblical theology, the works comprising New Studies in Biblical Theology are creative attempts to help Christians better understand their Bibles.

Carson, aiming to simultaneously instruct and to edify, to interact with current scholarship and to point the way ahead.</p><p>Harris is professor emeritus of New Testament exegesis and theology at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois.

At least she managed not to fall on her face. Half a block ahead, her cousin&#x2019;s veil fluttered behind her as she led the charge to the next bar.<br> <br>Grace had liked the steampunk place, especially because they didn&#x2019;t have a bouncer. But Bella had gotten bored and wanted to go somewhere with a band. It was Sixth Street, after all&#x2014;the nightlife capital of Austin, the live-music capital of the world, supposedly.<br> <br>Grace&#x2019;s thighs chafed together as she race-walked to catch up with Bella&#x2019;s friends, all blond and all sorority sisters, including a Sienna, a Sierra, and two Rileys. Grace had sat beside Sierra at dinner and learned that she was an intern at a B-to-B marketing firm in Dallas&#x2014;whatever that meant. Grace hadn&#x2019;t gotten much from the conversation. The woman had basically stopped talking once she figured out that Grace was not only underage but also a student at a podunk community college.<br> <br>They reached the bar, a warehouse-style building with a rooftop deck. A guitar chord ripped through the air above them as the band warmed up. Their entourage pressed close to Bella as she neared the door. She flirted with the bouncer, drawing his attention to the BRIDE sash draped over her breasts. He smiled and waved them in.<br> <br>A man bumped into Grace, jostling her sideways.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, sorry,&#x201d; he slurred.<br> <br>Grace stepped around him just as the Rileys disappeared through the door. Grace rushed to follow, but the bouncer grabbed her arm.<br> <br>&#x201c;ID?&#x201d;<br> <br>She unzipped her wristlet and took it out. The bouncer plucked it from her hand, and Grace held her breath as he studied it. It wasn&#x2019;t bad. Actually, it was good. It had a real Texas seal and a bar code on the back. The bouncer looked from the photo to Grace and shook his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; He handed it back.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t let you in with that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Step back.&#x201d; He reached over her for another girl&#x2019;s license. She looked sixteen, but she was thin and pretty. He barely glanced at her before waving her through.<br> <br>Burning with humiliation, Grace stepped away from the door. She looked up at the rooftop deck and took out her phone.<br> <br>Crap, what to write? She decided to go for lighthearted.<br> <br>My ID didn&#x2019;t work! Followed by three crying-face emojis.<br> <br>Grace tucked the ID away and stood in the sweltering heat, waiting for Bella&#x2019;s response. Would she come down and sweet-talk the bouncer? Round everyone up to go to another bar? Yeah, right. Grace wasn&#x2019;t betting on it.<br> <br>A text bubble popped up as Bella started to respond. Then it disappeared.<br> <br>Grace bit her lip. Sweat pooled in the cups of the tight strapless bra she&#x2019;d worn with her off-the-shoulder blouse. She waited a minute. Two. Three. A bitter lump lodged in her throat. She should have known this would happen.<br> <br>Grace took a deep breath and texted again: no worries see you back at the hotel later!<br> <br>She waited another minute, but still no response. Clutching the strap of her wristlet, she set off down the street. She held her head high, as though there was nowhere she&#x2019;d rather be right now than walking down Sixth Street all by herself. Grace blinked back tears. The hotel was eight blocks away, maybe nine, and the straps of her shoes cut into her skin.<br> <br>She never should have come. She didn&#x2019;t know these people, and she couldn&#x2019;t afford it. She&#x2019;d come for Bella, but her cousin had been too wrapped up in the wedding plans to even talk to her. Now Grace had wasted not only a weekend she could have worked but thirty dollars&#x2019; worth of gas, plus her share of the hotel room.<br> <br>She stopped on the corner and looked around. Where the hell was the hotel? It had to be close. She took out her phone to check the map.<br> <br>An SUV pulled over, its window rolling down.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, you call for a ride?&#x201d; the driver asked. He wore a baseball cap and a blue button-down shirt that matched his eyes.<br> <br>Grace noted the sticker on his windshield. &#x201c;No, not me.&#x201d;<br> <br>He smiled. &#x201c;Would you like one?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have the app, sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked her over. &#x201c;Tell you what, I&#x2019;ll make an exception. You can pay cash. Where you going?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Marriott.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Five bucks.&#x201d;<br> <br>Grace hesitated. She should walk. It couldn&#x2019;t be more than a few blocks away. But thinking of her raw feet, she reached for the door.<br> <br>The back seat was clean and spacious. It smelled like pi�a coladas and faintly of vomit. She noticed the pineapple-shaped air freshener dangling from the rearview mirror.<br> <br>Grace checked her messages as he pulled away from the curb.<br> <br>&#x201c;You here for the festival?&#x201d;<br> <br>She glanced up. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The music festival?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. A bachelorette party.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where you from?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Houston,&#x201d; she lied.<br> <br>A text came in from Bella. Two frowny emojis and then, ok c u soon!!<br> <br>Of course, she&#x2019;d waited until now to respond, when there was no chance of Grace ruining their plans.<br> <br>Grace should have listened to her mom. She&#x2019;d always said Bella was selfish. Well, she&#x2019;d never said those exact words. But she knew what her mom thought of her own sister, and she&#x2019;d said, The apple doesn&#x2019;t fall far from the tree with that one.<br> <br>They turned into an alley, and Grace glanced around, startled. &#x201c;Um, the hotel&#x2019;s on Brazos Street?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shortcut.&#x201d;<br> <br>His eyes met hers in the rearview mirror, and Grace&#x2019;s skin went cold.<br> <br>She pulled out a twenty-dollar bill. &#x201c;Actually, just drop me off here, thanks.&#x201d;<br> <br>He turned into an even darker alley beside a parking garage. Grace&#x2019;s throat went dry as he rolled to a stop.<br> <br>She lunged for the door, but it wouldn&#x2019;t open. Her heart hiccuped as he turned in his seat and reached back.<br> <br>Pain blazed through her, and she reeled sideways. She couldn&#x2019;t move, couldn&#x2019;t breathe. She tried to lift her head.<br> <br>Another jolt fired through her body, this one bigger and brighter, like grabbing a live wire. White-hot pain seared her. She couldn&#x2019;t move or hear, but she tasted blood and smelled her clothes burning.<br> <br>And then there was nothing.<br> <br>Nothing, nothing, nothing, only black.</p><h2>Native American Tarot Deck (Religion and Spirituality)</h2><p>A variety of Native American tribes are authentically represented in this tarot deck.

The story that emerges is not just a story of long hours, little pay, and hazardous working conditions; it is also the uniquely American story of immigrant families working together to make a new life for themselves. It is a story of hardship and sacrifice, yet also of triumph and the fulfillment of hopes and dreams.</p><p><b>Susan Campbell Bartoletti</b> is the award-winning author of several books for young readers, including <i>Black Potatoes: The Story of the Great Irish Famine, 1845&#x2013;1850,</i> winner of the Robert F. Sibert Medal. She lives in Moscow, Pennsylvania. Visit her website at&nbsp;<b>www.scbartoletti.com</b>.Bartoletti has written a concise, thoroughly researched account of the often grim working and living conditions in Pennsylvania coal towns. An accessible writing style, as well as the abundance of stimulating information, makes for an engrossing historical account. Quotes from personal interviews with miners, as well as taped interviews and transcripts, provide a refreshing first person frame of reference. Horn Book<br><br>With compelling black-and-white photographs of children at work in the coal mines of northeastern Pennsylvania about 100 years ago, this handsome, spacious photo-essay will draw browsers as well as students doing research on labor and immigrant history. The story of these boys' lives are a part of Russell Freedman's general overview Kids at Work (1994) and of Betsy Harvey Kraft's biography Mother Jones (1995); but there's a wealth of personal detail and family story here that focuses on what it was like in the mines and in the homes and communities of these working children. Lewis Hines' famous pictures will grab readers, and Bartoletti has also gathered dozens of archival photos and heartbreaking oral histories. They show what it was like for eight-year-old breaker boys sorting coal surrounded by deafening noise and black clouds of dust, steam, and smoke; what it was like to be a mule driver underground; what it meant to be a spragger, a butty, a nipper. Drawing on personal interviews, archival tapes and transcripts, and a wide range of historical resources, Bartoletti finds heartfelt memories of long hours, hard labor, and extremely dangerous working conditions, as well as lighter accounts of spirited rebellion, mischief, and bonding. The immigrant experience is an integral part of this "coal culture": the strength of ethnic groups and the prejudice against them, and their banding together to form strong labor unions. As with most fine juvenile nonfiction, this will also have great appeal for adults.<br>Booklist, ALA, Starred Review<br><br>Bartoletti uses oral history, archival documents, and an abundance of black-and-white photographs to make turn-of-the-century mining life a surprisingly compelling subject for today's young people.<br>School Library Journal, Starred</p><h2>The Tolkien Years of the Brothers Hildebrandt</h2><p>Now available, just in time for the Peter Jackson <i>Hobbit</i> films!

Still reeling from the end of his obsessive courtship of a young SoHo artist/waiter, Seth moves between a room at the Chateau Marmont and a Mount Washington shack owned by his old cab-driving, ex-Marxist friend, Jack, while he writes a profile of Teddy Wade&#x2015;one of the era's hottest young actors, who has &#x201c;dared&#x201d; to star as a gay character in a new Hollywood film. Studded throughout with scathing satirical portraits of media figures, other writers, and the Martinez trial teams, <i>Resentment </i>captures an era that seems, two decades later, at once grotesque, familiar, and a precursor to our own.</p></p><p>Since the mid-1970s, Gary Indiana has been making a name for himself as a renegade thinker and writer. In the <i>Village Voice</i> and <i>Rolling Stone</i> he created a new brand of highly personal, overtly political cultural commentary that has reshaped journalism. His novels and short stories are equally controversial. <i>Resentment,</i> his new novel, is a true hybrid of his art. Based on Indiana's coverage of the Menendez brothers' trial, the novel is an all-out, savagely funny attack on the media, the U.S. justice system, television, family, and Los Angeles. Indiana is relentless in his desire to expose the insanity that rages beneath the surface of U.S. life and determined to make us laugh out loud even as we shake our heads in sorry recognition.<i>Day of the Locusts</i> meets <i>Bonfire of the Vanities</i> in this searing burlesque about everyone from the east coast literati to Hollywood's superagents, actors, has-beens and wannabes. Gary Indiana takes no prisoners as he sets his "hero," B-magazine writer Seth, out in Los Angeles to do a celebrity profile of a famous hetero actor who has just taken a major role as a homosexual with AIDS. While on the West Coast, Seth becomes mildly, then completely obsessed with the trial of two privileged young men who are accused of killing their parents in cold blood as they lay sleeping in their Beverly Hills home. <p></p><p>Indiana weaves the story of Seth and his not inconsequential resentment for the world at large with the riveting "Martinez" case as it unfolds before the American public. Ironically, hilariously, and ingeniously, Indiana juxtaposes both stories in this blackest of comedies, as he reveals the role of resentment in all human relationships, and the darker side of L.A. roiling beneath the glamour. The media loves nothing more than itself, and no writer/agent/actor/journalist will be able to resist this tell-all novel about all the beautiful people.</p></p><h2>Flunking Sainthood: A Year of Breaking the Sabbath, Forgetting to Pray, and Still Loving My Neighbor</h2><p>This wry memoir tackles twelve different spiritual practices in a quest to become more saintly, including fasting, fixed-hour prayer, the Jesus Prayer, gratitude, Sabbath-keeping, and generosity. Although Riess begins with great plans for success ("Really, how hard could that be?" she asks blithely at the start of her saint-making year), she finds to her growing humiliation that she is failing--not just at some of the practices, but at every single one. What emerges is a funny yet vulnerable story of the quest for spiritual perfection and the reality of spiritual failure, which turns out to be a valuable practice in and of itself.<br>&nbsp;<br>Praise for <i>Flunking Sainthood:</i><br>"Jana Riess may have flunked at sainthood, but she's written a wonderful book. It's both reverent and irreverent, and it will make you want to become a better Christian -- or Jew, or Muslim, or Zoroastrian, or Jedi, or whatever you happen to be." -&nbsp; AJ Jacobs, author of <i>The Year of Living Biblically</i><br><i></i><br>"<i>Flunking Sainthood</i> is surprising and freeing; it is fun and funny; and it is full of wisdom. It is, in fact, the best book on the practices of the spiritual life that I have read in a long, long time."&nbsp; - Lauren Winner, author of <i>Girl Meets God</i> and <i>Mudhouse Sabbath</i><br>&nbsp;"Jana Riess reminds us that saints are different from most of us: They are special, we are barely normal. They get it right, we rarely get it. They see God, we strain to see much of anything. And, Jana is no saint. Rather than climbing to the pinnacle and sitting on a pedestal to tell us how it could be, Jana slides right next to us and reminds us that sainthood is overrated. With humor and insight she whispers to is that our lives matter just as they are. She prods us to never let our failures hold us back. She calls us to something greater than spiritual success - ordinary faithfulness. <i>Flunking Sainthood</i> is the book I'm giving to my friends who are seeking to make sense of their emerging faith." - Doug Pagitt, author of <i>A Christianity Worth Believing </i> <br> &nbsp;<br> "Warm, light-hearted, and laugh-out-loud funny, Jana Riess may indeed have flunked sainthood, but this memoir assures us that she is utterly and deeply human, and that is something even more wonderful. Honest and sincere, she will endear you from page one."&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Donna Freitas, author of <i>The Possibilities of Sainthood</i><br>&nbsp;<br> <br> "With a helpfully hilarious account of her own grappling with godliness, Jana Riess proves to be a standup historian well-practiced in the art of oddly revivifying self-deprecation. She loves her guides, historical and contemporary, even as she finds them alternately impractical, harsh, or "infuriatingly jolly." The book is freaking wonderful--a candid and committed tale of prayers that resists supersizing and spirituality that has no home save the glory and the muck of the everyday."--David Dark, author of <i>The Sacredness of Questioning Everything</i><br> <br> "Jana Riess's new book is a delight--fun, funny, engaging and a powerful reminder that the greatest work in our lives is not what we'll do for God but what God is doing in us."&nbsp;&nbsp; --Margaret Feinberg, margaretfeinberg.com, author of <i>Scouting the Divine</i> and <i>Hungry for God</i><br>&nbsp;<br><i>"Flunking Sainthood</i> allows those of us who have attempted new spiritual practices-- and failed--to breathe a great sigh of relief and to laugh out loud. Jana Riess's expos� of her year-long and less-than-successful attempts at eleven classic spiritual practices entertains and educates us with its honesty and down-to-earthiness. In spite of Jana's paltry attempts at piety and her botched prayer makeovers, God showed up in the surprising, sneaky ways that only God does. Jana is the kind of girlfriend I like to have--hilarious, smart, stubborn, irreverent, and totally gaga over God." --Sybil MacBeth, author of <i>Praying in Color</i><br></p><p><p></p><p>Jana Riess is the author or editor of nine books, including <i>What Would Buffy Do? </i>Although she is a spiritual failure and was never able to climb the rope in gym class, she has a doctorate from Columbia University and teaches religion at Miami University. She blogs at http://blog.beliefnet.com/flunkingsainthood/.</p><p></p><p>It's clear from the start of this sparkling and very funny memoir that Riess means well. But as she readily admits, she's a spiritual failure. She intended to devote an entire year ("a year-long experiment") to mastering 12 different spiritual challenges, including praying at fixed times during the day, exhibiting gratitude, observing the Sabbath, practicing hospitality according to the rules set by St. Benedict, abstaining from eating meat, and amply demonstrating her generosity. But nothing turned out as planned. Rather than being moved by Therese of Lisieux's The Story of a Soul, she instead dismisses the saint as a "drama queen." And Reiss is unregenerately practical. The best month to fast, she reasons, is February, at the height of winter; conveniently, it's also the shortest month of the year. Furthermore, at best, she's a "lukewarm vegetarian." Although her spiritual quest falls far short, she can still proffer spiritual lessons. Anyone who has failed to live up to expectations, which means most everyone, will love this book.</p><p><b><i>Booklist</i></b>, September 15, 2011</p><br><br><p>STARRED&nbsp;REVIEW&nbsp;- <i>Publishers Weekly - </i>Punchy humor and unpretentious inquisitiveness combine in this absorbing memoir in which former <i>PW</i> editor Riess (<i>What Would Buffy Do?)</i> commits to both adopting and studying a new religious practice each month for a year, while simultaneously reflecting on her spiritual progress. Choosing such diverse disciplines as fasting &#x201c;like a Muslim during Ramadan,&#x201d; exploring<i> lectio divina, </i>observing an Orthodox Jewish Sabbath, practicing Benedictine hospitality, and engaging in the Liturgy of the Hours, the author shares frustrations and insights in a manner likely to amuse and comfort readers, especially those who have attempted such exercises and also found them challenging. For example, Riess&#x2019;s description of her internal dialogue during Centering Prayer, concludes, &#x201c;&nbsp;&#x2018;Shut the hell up!&#x2019; yells Spiritual Mind,&#x201d; while her experience of practicing mindfulness, with annoying help from the never sainted Brother Lawrence, leads to a sympathetic observation that he&#x2019;s &#x201c;an underappreciated housewife.&#x201d; Supporting quotes from saints and writers (St. John Chrysostom, Dorothy Day, Thornton Wilder) pepper the text. The author&#x2019;s declared &#x201c;failures&#x201d; make her a sympathetic witness, while such &#x201c;successes&#x201d; as her description of how &#x201c;[g]ratitude practically tackles me,&#x201d; prove genuinely moving. A witty, inspiring read.<i>(Nov.)</i></p><br><br>Flunking Sainthood has to be the most entertaining introduction to spiritual disciplines ever written. If your taste in spiritual discipline runs to hair shirts and beds of nails, you probably won't care for this book. As an honest, funny, irreverent introduction to time-honored Christian practices, however, it can't be beat. - Lavonne Neff<br><br>When I first encountered the title&nbsp;<i><b>Flunking Sainthood: A year of breaking the sabbath, forgetting to pray, and still loving my neighbor</b></i>, I thought, &#x201c;That sounds like me in my stumbling efforts.&#x201d; I sensed I would find a kindred spirit in author Jana Riess, and I read this memoir hungrily.<br> I enjoyed this book very much and could identify with the author&#x2019;s longing to cultivate good habits and to deepen prayer life. I laughed aloud, and nodded my head in solidarity. I, too, have craved closeness with God, and tried many practices suggested by spiritual leaders. The chapter on praying the liturgy of the hours (or divine office) really struck home. I have been trying, unsuccessfully, to read morning psalms and then the compline prayer service at bedtime each day. Rather than feeling frustrated when I forget to do this, I enjoy the prayer time when it happens. After all, the quiet time is a gift to myself, and not an obligation in any way.<br> The chapter on Benedictine hospitality sent me straight to the library so that I could reread the&nbsp;<i>Rule of Saint Benedict</i>. How I long to be able to live the instruction that &#x201c;all guests who present themselves are to be welcomed as Christ, for he himself will say: &#x2018;I was a stranger and you welcomed me.'&#x201d; As Jana Riess experienced, it is not easy in our fast-paced culture to slow down and enjoy our unexpected encounters with people.<br> While I read&nbsp;<i>Flunking Sainthood</i>&nbsp;in two eager sittings, I appreciated that the book could be picked up once a month, taking one chapter at a time and trying a spiritual discipline alongside&nbsp;Jana Riess. For this reason&nbsp;<b><i>Flunking Sainthood</i></b> would make an ideal read for the start of the new year, when many of us try to adopt positive habits. Perhaps you long to try&nbsp;<i>lectio divina</i>, centering prayer, or a deeper sabbath observance. With&nbsp;<i><b>Flunking Sainthood</b></i>, you can enjoy the companionship of&nbsp;Jana Riess&nbsp;as you experiment and journey.<br> The honesty and sincerity in the writing of&nbsp;Jana Riess&nbsp;provide encouragement, inspiration, and laughter. I am excited to see that Paraclete Press has published a useful companion volume,&nbsp;<b><i>Flunking Sainthood Every Day: A daily devotional for the rest of us</i></b>. <b>&#x2014;Lisa, <i>Light to Read By</i></b><br></p><h2>Thea Stilton and the Mystery on the Orient Express (Thea Stilton #13): A Geronimo Stilton Adventure</h2><p>Geronimo's adventurous sister Thea narrates this fabulous adventure that's packed with action, mystery, and friendship!<br><br>The Thea Sisters are boarding the famouse Orient Express for a journey from Paris to Istanbul!

Within two centuries, China was home to nearly half of all humankind. In this concise history, we learn why the inventiveness of this era has been favorably compared with the European Renaissance, which in many ways the Song transformation surpassed.</p><p>With the chaotic dissolution of the Tang dynasty, the old aristocratic families vanished. A new class of scholar-officials&#x2015;products of a meritocratic examination system&#x2015;took up the task of reshaping Chinese tradition by adapting the precepts of Confucianism to a rapidly changing world. Through fiscal reforms, these elites liberalized the economy, eased the tax burden, and put paper money into circulation. Their redesigned capitals buzzed with traders, while the education system offered advancement to talented men of modest means. Their rationalist approach led to inventions in printing, shipbuilding, weaving, ceramics manufacture, mining, and agriculture. With a realist&#x2019;s eye, they studied the natural world and applied their observations in art and science. And with the souls of diplomats, they chose peace over war with the aggressors on their borders. Yet persistent military threats from these nomadic tribes&#x2015;which the Chinese scorned as their cultural inferiors&#x2015;redefined China&#x2019;s understanding of its place in the world and solidified a sense of what it meant to be Chinese. </p><p><i>The Age of Confucian Rule</i> is an essential introduction to this transformative era. &#x201c;A scholar should congratulate himself that he has been born in such a time&#x201d; (Zhao Ruyu, 1194).</p></p><p><p>Dieter Kuhn was Professor and Chair of Chinese Studies, University of W�rzburg.</p><p>Timothy Brook is Professor of History and Republic of China Chair at the University of British Columbia.</p>&#x201c;One of the leading historians of the Song period offers an empirically rich and well-informed book that is especially good on material culture and the history of technology. Kuhn offers strong overviews of the transformation of the capital cities, education and examination, commerce, and the Song fiscal system, as well as lively discussions of religious beliefs, the study of natural phenomena, and private life in the public sphere. For readers who want an in-depth look at mid-imperial Chinese history and culture, Dieter Kuhn's <i>Age of Confucian Rule</i> promises to become the book of choice.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Paul Jakov Smith, Haverford College</b><br><br>&#x201c;The first four chapters of this well-researched, clearly written book present a balanced synopsis of the political, institutional, and military history of Song and its neighbors during some three centuries, when this was 'the most advanced civilization on earth.' The remaining eight chapters deal with thought, life cycle rituals, poetry and painting, education and the examination system, dynastic capitals, the world of production, money and taxation, private lives, and the public sphere. The author's enthusiasm is matched by his erudition and outstanding expertise in Song material culture as he ranges widely from the plethora of goods for sale in bustling shops and markets to the origins of foot binding, and finds space for dental hygiene as well as tomb construction...Scholars already versed in the period can learn much from this book, while those just beginning to delve into Chinese history are very well served.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>C.

This is because only through the cross can God's eternal purpose concerning His Son as well as His church be realized. "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified," declared the apostle Paul (1 Cor. 2.2).&nbsp; Christ came to us by way of the cross, and only by this same way do we know Him. Unless the cross is accepted by us both objectively in terms of the finished work of Christ at Calvary and subjectively in terms of the dealing of the Holy Spirit in us, we have no message to deliver to the world and we are not fit to be its messengers.&nbsp; In this present volume, Watchman Nee shows us that at the source of all spiritual things stands the cross. In order that Christ may be all and in all, there is no effective means save the cross. How we therefore need to pray, "Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me and know my thoughts" (Ps. 139.23), so that by God's response to such heartfelt prayer we may have a true knowledge of our selves. Now such response will mean our having to experience the dividing of our spirit and soul, since the root of all sins is the fallen self life of man. Yet, as the author makes clear, with the self thus dealt with, we can then be true messengers of the cross.&nbsp; May God raise up many such messengers today.</p><p></p><h2>The Queen&#39;s Jewels (Murder, She Wrote, Book 34)</h2><p>Jessica Fletcher has always wanted to take a transatlantic voyage on the legendary <i>Queen Mary 2</i>.

It is also a classic work in the theology of the Church. Indeed, de Lubac's profound insights significantly contributed to Vatican II's Dogmatic Constitution on the Church,&nbsp;<i>Lumen Gentium</i>, especially in its treatment on the Church as mystery and as the Sacrament of Christ.</p><p></p></p><p><p><strong>Henri de Lubac, S. J.</strong>, was considered as one of the most important theologians of the twentieth century. Together with the works of other towering modern theologians (and friends) Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI) and Hans Urs von Balthasar, the writings of de Lubac stand out as crucial to twentieth-century Catholicism. Among his other famous books are <i>Catholicism: Christ and the Common Destiny of Man<i>,<i>The Splendor of the Church<i>,<i>The Christian Faith<i>,<i>The Drama of Atheist Humanism<i>, and<i>The Motherhood of the Church.<i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Assumption of Mary</h2><p>The last dogma defined by the Church is the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into heavenly glory. This dogma is the gateway to answer one of the greatest problems that has ever faced the human race. What is the meaning of life? Is death the end of everything? <br> <br> Mary's Assumption tells us that eternal life with God is the final evolution of every man and woman who dies in the friendship of God. At the end of time all will be taken up and transformed, the body and the soul, the corporeal and the spiritual. For all that God created is sacred and loved. Where Mary is, all the elect will be. Whoever contemplates this mystery learns much about God, Christ, Mary, the Church and oneself. <br> <br> The Virgin Mary is one who walked in the darkness of faith and never despaired, one who obeyed and never deserted, one who loved and was never unfaithful. She is an example of the perfect disciple. Mary was Jesus' first and the most perfect disciple of Christ. <br> <br> The Virgin Mary, taken up into heaven after her earthly life, remains for us the symbol of all that we should be, and of all that we will be, if only we are faithful to Christ. She is the woman in the life of Christ and the woman in the life of all who follow him. <br> <br> On earth Mary was the mother of Jesus and his wholehearted companion, his comfort and joy. Now in heaven close to Jesus, she watches over us with a mother's care and intercedes for us. She is our life, our sweetness and our hope. She is our shining example. Where she is, we shall be. God knows we need the woman clothed in glory. <br> <br> The purpose of this book is to contemplate the Virgin Mary in her heavenly glory. The book's reflections go beyond the mystery of the Assumption in itself to contemplate the Mother of God in glory in relation to Christ and the Church. For Mary in glory is close to Christ and the people of God. We hope to penetrate more deeply this twofold mystery. <br> <br> To facilitate this task, the book is divided the study into two parts: The Assumption in the Mystery of Christ, and the Assumption in the Mystery of the Church. <br> <br> The first part follows the model of Chapter eight of the<em> Constitution on the Church </em>of the Second Vatican Council. There as here, Mary is considered first in the mystery of Christ and then in the mystery of the Church. <br> <br> The first part is actually a commentary on the Apostolic Constitution <em>Munificentissimus Deus </em>that defined the dogma of the Assumption. It is here we perceive that the Assumption is not an isolated privilege granted to Mary, but one that is intimately joined with the person and mission of Christ. Her triumphal entrance into glory is part of Christ's victory over sin and death. <br> <br> The second part goes beyond the Constitution and ponders the Immaculate Virgin in heaven in relation to the mystery of the Church. The first consideration is Mary in heaven as the model, image and beginning of the pilgrim Church. This is followed by her relation to the suffering and heavenly Church. The final chapter ponders the texts of the liturgical feast of the Assumption. It is in the liturgy of the feast that we experience God's love for the human family; Mary's inseparable union with Christ her Son and Savior, and the joy that we are called to experience once our pilgrimage of faith is over. For, taken up to heaven we join Mary in the communion of saints in union with Christ our Lord.</p><p></p><h2>The Tapping Solution for Manifesting Your Greatest Self: 21 Days to Releasing Self-Doubt, Cultivating Inner Peace, and Creating a Life You Love</h2><p><b>New in paperback: The New York Times best-selling creator of the Tapping Solution offers a three-week program of practical self-inquiry and hands-on work designed to unlock your life's full potential.</b><br><br>Have you ever had the feeling your life just isn't working?

At one level, this is a book about the courage, humor, and determination to triumph over illness and disability that many "ordinary people" demonstrate when coping with the extraordinary stress of a brain disorder. On another level, it is a well-referenced and up-to-date textbook that provides a holistic view of the practice of clinical neuropsychology. Included are reader-friendly descriptions and explanations of a wide range of neurological disorders and neuroscientific concepts. Two introductory chapters are followed by 17 chapters that each focus on a specific disorder and include research, clinical assessment, rehabilitation, and a detailed case study. Disorders range across the full spectrum from common ones such as traumatic brain injury and dementia, to rare disorders such as autotopagnosia. Each of the 16 chapters retained from the first edition has been revised to reflect current research and clinical advances. Three new chapters on multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease incorporate discussion of important current topics such as genetically-transmitted diseases, genetic counseling, gene transplantation, functional neurosurgery, and the complex ethical issues that go hand-in-hand with these new techniques. This informative and engaging book will be of interest to students of clinical psychology, neuropsychology, and neurology, health professionals who work with neurological patients, neurological patients and their families, and lay readers who are simply fascinated by the mind and brain.<br></p><p>Jenni Ogden, Ph.D., FRSNZ, FNZPS, worked as a university professor, researcher and practitioner in the fields of clinical psychology and neuropsychology for 27 years.

The development of such key ideas as religion, science, and philosophy form the central narrative of this book.<br><br><em>Cultures of the West</em> stands apart from other textbooks in a variety of ways, the first being thematic unity. What did people think and believe, throughout our history, about human nature, the right way to live, God, the best forms of government, or the meaning of human life? Rather than maintaining a single interpretive stance, author Clifford R. Backman relies upon a consistent set of questions: What did people think and feel throughout the centuries about politics, science, religion, and sex? How did they come to their positions regarding the right way to live? Backman's many years of experience in the classroom have informed his approach--students respond to engaging questions more than they are inspired by facts.<br></p><p><br><strong>Clifford R.

At a time when the topic of Western Civilization is under great scrutiny, Backman brings to light many of the notable achievements of the West and their connection to a larger value system."--Anthony Nardini, <em>Rowan University</em><p></p><br>"<em>Cultures of the West</em> is professional, informative, clear, and well-written. Backman's approach of considering values behind institutions and events is clever and unique."--Carolyn Coretti, <em>The University of Mississippi</em><p></p><br>"This is an innovative approach to the history of the Western world, with an emphasis on the values behind historical changes and challenges. It offers a unique approach to the traditional histories of Western civilization by providing a focus on contributions from the Middle East along with the usual political and social narrative."--Matthew Ruane, <em>Florida Institute of Technology</em><p></p><br>"<em>Cultures of the West</em> is an excellent choice because of the singular narrative that focuses on culture while still communicating the important aspects needed for a survey course."--Patrice Laurent Diaz, <em>Montgomery County Community College</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Critical Race Theory: The Cutting Edge</h2><p>Critical race theory has become a dynamic, eclectic, and growing movement in the study of law.

Conventional wisdom says no, that a lucky few are simply born with certain gifts.&nbsp;The new science of human potential suggests otherwise. Forget everything you think you know about genes, talent, and intelligence, and take a look at the amazing new evidence.<br><br> Here, interweaving cutting-edge research from numerous scientific fields, David Shenk offers a new view of human potential, giving readers more of a sense of ownership over their accomplishments, and freeing parents from the bonds of genetic determinism. As Shenk points out, our genes are not a &#x201c;blueprint&#x201d; that dictate individual destinies. Rather we are all the product of interplay between genes and outside stimuli&#x2014;a dynamic that we can influence. It is a revolutionary and life-changing message.</p><p><strong>Louann Brizendine Reviews <em>The Genius In All of Us</em></strong> <br> <br> <strong> Louann Brizendine, M.D.,author of <em>The Female Brain</em> and <em>The Male Brain</em>, is a diplomat of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and the National Board of Medical Examiners, and is clinical professor of psychiatry at UCSF. She is founder and director of the Women's Mood and Hormone Clinic and the Teen Girl Mood and Hormone Clinic. After receiving her medical degree from Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, she completed an internship in medicine and neurology at Harvard Medical School's Brigham and Women's Hospital, and a residency in psychiatry at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center of Harvard Medical School. She sits on the boards of many prestigious peer reviewed journals and is the recipient of numerous honors and awards. Read Brizendine's guest review of <em>The Genius In All of Us</em>:</strong> <br> <p> </p> <p>In <i>The Genius in All of Us</i> Shenk beautifully explains why the nature-nurture debate is dead. It is not just the genes we are born with, but how we are raised and what opportunities are open to us that determine how smart we will become. Nurture and experience reshape our genes, and thus our brain. Shenk argues that the idea we are either born with genius or talent, or we aren&#x2019;t, is simply untrue. The notion that relentless, deliberate practice changes the brain and thus our abilities has been undervalued over the past 30 years in favor of the concept of &#x201c;innate giftedness.&#x201d; Practice, practice, practice (some say 10,000 hours or more) is what it takes. Shenk argues that it is just some fantasy that effortless, gifted genius is born and not made. He marshals evidence to show that genetic factors do not trump environmental factors but rather work in concert with them. Shenk notes that by the sweat of our brow we can train ourselves to be successful--even if we are born with only average genetic talent. Scientists know that how we are raised and how we are trained affects the expression of our genes. If you think you&#x2019;ve reached your talent limit, think again, Shenk says. It&#x2019;s not just in your genes, he says, but in the intensity of your motivation. Ambition, persistence, and self-discipline are not just products of genes, but can be shaped by nurture and environment. Certainly it is important to have good genes, but that determines at most only 50 percent of your talent. He underscores the point that intelligence is made up of the skills that a person has developed--with an emphasis on &#x201c;developed&#x201d;--through hard work. Encouraging ourselves and our children to work hard requires being surrounded by others also wanting to achieve striving for excellence. Moreover, Shenk gives the hopeful message not just for kids, but also for adults. Happily for us, the human brain remains plastic, changeable and trainable well into old age. So no matter how old you are, if you&#x2019;d like to be smarter--get to work! <em>--Louann Brizendine</em></p> <strong>A Q&amp;A with David Shenk</strong> <br> <p> </p> <b>Question:</b> Your book is called <i>The Genius in All of Us: Why Everything You&#x2019;ve Been Told About Genetics, Talent, and IQ is Wrong</i>. That&#x2019;s a big claim. Everything and how so?<p></p> <p><b>David Shenk:</b> It is a bold statement, and it reflects how poorly the public has been served when it comes to understanding the relationship between biology and ability. The clich�s we&#x2019;ve been taught about genetic blueprints, IQ, and "giftedness" all come out of crude, early-20th century guesswork. The reality is so much more interesting and complex. Genes do have a powerful influence on everything we do, but they respond to their environments in all sorts of interesting ways. We&#x2019;ve now learned a lot more about the developmental mechanisms that enable people to get really good at stuff. Intelligence and talent turn out to be about process, not about whether you were born with certain "gifts."</p> <p><b>Question:</b> In <i>The Genius in All of Us</i> you state that the concept of nature versus nurture is over. Scientists, cognitive psychologists, and geneticists are moving towards an idea of &#x2018;interactionism.' What does this mean? If the battle of genes versus environment is over, who has won? Which is more important?</p> <p><b>David Shenk:</b> They both won, because they're both vitally important. But the new science shows us that they do not act separately. Declaring that a person gets X-percent of his/her intelligence from genes and Y-percent from the environment is like saying that X-percent of Shakespeare's greatness can be found in his verbs, and Y-percent in his adjectives. There is no nature vs. nurture, or nature plus nurture; instead, it's nature interacting with nurture, which is often expressed by scientists as "GxE" (genes times intelligence). This is what "interactionism" refers to. A vanguard of geneticists, neuroscientists, and psychologists have stepped forward in recent years to articulate the importance of the dynamic interaction between genes and the environment.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> You describe genes and environment as a sound board. How so?</p> <p><b>David Shenk:</b> In the past, we&#x2019;ve been taught that each distinct gene contains a certain dossier of information, which in turn determines a certain trait; if you have the blue-eyed gene, you get blue eyes. Period.</p> <p>It turns out, though, that the information contained inside genes is only part of the story; another critical part is how often genes get "expressed," or turned on, by other genes and by outside forces. It&#x2019;s therefore helpful to think of your genome as a giant mixing board with thousands of knobs and switches. Genes are always getting turned on/off/up/down by hormones, nutrients, etc. People actually affect their own genome&#x2019;s behavior with their actions. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> How do these new findings affect the concept of the "The Bell Curve"--that we live in an increasingly stratified world where the "cognitive elite," those with the best genes, are more and more isolated from the cognitive/genetic underclass? Is that idea now completely obsolete? </p> <p><b>David Shenk:</b> Yes, it is obsolete. The idea that there is a genetic super-class that has a corner on high-IQ genes is nonsense. This comes out of a profound misunderstanding of how genes work and how intelligence works, and also from a misreading of so-called "heritability" studies. I am not saying that genes don&#x2019;t affect intelligence. Genes affect everything. But by and large I think the evidence shows that people with low intelligence are missing out on key developmental advantages.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> Lewis Terman invented the IQ test at Stanford University in 1916. He declared it the ideal tool to determine a person&#x2019;s native intelligence. Are IQ tests accurate? What are the benefits and fallout of the IQ test?</p> <p><b>David Shenk:</b> IQ tests accurately rank academic achievement. That&#x2019;s quite different from identifying innate intelligence, which doesn&#x2019;t really exist. Tufts intelligence expert Robert Sternberg explains that "intelligence represents a set of competencies in development." In other words, intelligence isn&#x2019;t fixed. Intelligence isn&#x2019;t general. Intelligence is not a thing. Instead, intelligence is a dynamic, diffuse, and ongoing process.</p> <p>The IQ test has valid uses. It can help teachers and principals understand how well students are doing and what they&#x2019;re missing. But the widespread belief that it defines what each of us are capable of (and limited to) is disabling for individuals and society. People simply cannot reach their full potential if they honestly believe that they are so severely restricted. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> How do we go about finding the genius in all of us? What steps we can take to unlock latent talent?</p> <p><b>David Shenk:</b> Find the thing you love to do, and work and work and work at it. Don't be discouraged by failure; realize that high achievers thrive on failure as a motivating mechanism and as instruction guide on how to get better. </p> <p>(Photo � Alexandra Beers)</p>DAVID SHENK is the national bestselling author of five previous books, including&nbsp;<i>The Forgetting, Data Smog,</i>&nbsp;and most recently, <i>The Immortal Game.</i> He is a correspondent for&nbsp;TheAtlantic.com, and has contributed to&nbsp;<i>National Geographic, Slate, The New York Times, Gourmet, Harper&#x2019;s, The New Yorker,&nbsp;</i>NPR, and PBS.</p><h2>The Girl in the Flammable Skirt: Stories</h2><p><b>"A collection of wistful, witty stories." --<i>Esquire&nbsp;<br></i>"Hilarious, deep and a little bit dirty." --<i>Harper's Bazaar</i></b><br><br>A grief-stricken librarian decides to have sex with every man who enters her library. A half-mad, unbearably beautiful heiress follows a strange man home, seeking total sexual abandon: He only wants to watch game shows.

A wife whose husband has just returned from the war struggles with the heartrending question: Can she still love a man who has no lips?<br><br>Aimee Bender's stories portray a world twisted on its axis, a place of unconvention that resembles nothing so much as real life, in all its grotesque, beautiful glory. From the first line of each tale she lets us know she is telling a story, but the moral is never quite what we expect. Bender's prose is glorious: musical and colloquial, inimitable and heartrending.<br><br>Here are stories of men and women whose lives are shaped--and sometimes twisted--by the power of extraordinary desires, erotic and otherwise. <i>The Girl in the Flammable Skirt</i> is the debut of a major American writer.<br><br>A 1998 <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year. Selected by the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> as one of the best works of fiction of 1998.</p><p>In conventional fiction, war heroes return home minus an arm or a leg--or, to take Hemingway's worst-case scenario, the family jewels. In Aimee Bender's deeply unconventional collection, however, an even more suggestive body part goes AWOL: "Steve returned from the war without his lips." The army doctors have temporarily replaced them with a plastic disc, which impairs his speech. Luckily, this doesn't prevent him and his wife from engaging in some slightly surrealistic sexual maneuvers: "That night in bed, he grazed the disc over her raised nipples like a UFO and the plastic was cool on her skin. It felt like they were in college and toying with desk items as sexual objects."<p> That same combo--sex and off-kilter surrealism--provides Bender with her modus operandi. In "Call My Name," for example, a young heiress tails a stranger back to his apartment, gets her dress sliced off, and then consents to be trussed to a chair while he watches a TV documentary about Mozart. "Quiet Please" features a libidinous librarian who takes on all, uh, comers in the back room. Bender isn't, it should be said, simply a purveyor of French postcards. Her prose is exquisitely shaped, and its singsong rhythms suggest something out of a wised-up, whacked-out fairy tale. Indeed, if the Brothers Grimm had been a little more attuned to the pleasure principle, their fables might have boasted at least a family resemblance to Aimee Bender's. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>"Aimee Bender's debut is a string of jewels."<br><i>--Publishers Weekly</i><p>"Superbly imagined.

Richly illustrated, it combines history, environmental benefits and personal stories with simple how-to&#x2019;s for planning, growing and harvesting 6 important grains. Includes 12 chef-tested recipes for inspiration.</p> <p>This is a design book, too, with planting patterns and suggestions, no matter how much or how little garden space you have. These grains are ornamental grasses, and they show off beautifully in any setting. The grouped plantings reveal the grains&#x2019; varied colors and textures, interplanted with flowers like poppies, larkspur, snapdragons, nigella, zinnias, sunflowers and marigolds. Not only flowers, but salad greens and other decorative veggies play well with grains.</p><p><i>Gardening with Grains</i> is foodscaping for fun, beauty and bragging rights. . . and maybe even some homemade beer and bread.(Genus illustrations and garden plans by landscape architect and botanical artist Preston Montague.) </p></p><p><b>FOREWORD</b> <p>Greetings from my sunny front yard in Fuquay-Varina, NC. As I write this, it is late spring and the cool season grains are beginning to dry, making their statement all the more vividly. On this particular day, the breeze is strong and the humidity low. The sun sparkles and the cloudless Carolina blue sky provides the perfect backdrop to reflect on my grain journey.</p> <p>Kneeling on a soft patch of turf to inspect the wheat, I realize that grass is one of the last remnants of the &#x201c;normal&#x201d; landscape I inherited upon moving to my home in 2010. Eight years ago I would never have dreamt of the possibilities this former tobacco field would bring.</p> <p>The freshly mowed lawn serves as a perfect green backdrop for the spring show of grains as they turn amber. The arching stalks of barley, oats, rye and wheat wave in the breeze and glow in the sunshine. I&#x2019;m daydreaming of what this space will look like in September when it is replanted with warm season grains such as corn, millet, rice and sorghum. The possibilities are endless. </p> <p>Today is a day to dream, give thanks and reflect with gratitude. It&#x2019;s a day to take note of the simple moments like a bee buzzing overhead and appreciate the beauty that surrounds you. It&#x2019;s a day for me to hope that my ramblings will influence and inspire others to take up this great hobby of gardening and to perhaps inspire a few folks to toss some grain seed into the earth and experience this same joy. </p> <p>No question, I am more than a bit unconventional. Some may consider my style &#x201c;chaotic&#x201d; or &#x201c;natural.&#x201d; But in reality, these plantings are carefully planned, planted and managed from sowing to harvest. This diverse assortment of plants does not happen by accident. These dynamic colors and textures create a show that is intriguing visually and offers a compelling story and sense of place. </p> <p>I&#x2019;ve been a professional horticulturist and home gardener for twenty years and the only certainty is you will never stop learning from growing plants. No two seasons will ever the same. Gardening is the opposite of Groundhog Day, which is why it is such a special way to spend your time. You will fall in and out of love with different plants over the years as your life and garden change. You will have more or less time to devote as your journey ebbs and flows, but I encourage you to experiment with new plants as often as possible and reflect in the simple moments spent in your paradise. </p> <p>If someone had told me even five years ago that I would be investing my time and energy into writing a book on grains I would have explained that &#x201c;No, I am a woody ornamental propagator,&#x201d; and walked away. But then one day you wake up and try something new and your world gets that much bigger.</p> <p>That is what <i>Gardening with Grains</i> is aiming to achieve. I hope you will consider things you haven&#x2019;t thought of before and challenge your creativity as a gardener. I want you to dream big, beyond your home and neighborhood, and imagine the impact that we can all have on shaping and nourishing our communities. But most of all, I wish to inspire you to grow something new, in a different context, and enjoy the process along the way.</p><b>Brie Arthur</b> is recognized as one of the young leaders who are helping to determine the future of the horticulture industry.

The simplest reason was that I just wanted to be in a band with my friends. I'd been playing with Duke and Steve for several years, and now we had a new beginning with an X factor: a Scottish singer named Shirley. She seemed like a good fit for our little club of misfits. So we all took that leap."</i></p></p><p>Described by <i>Pitchfork</i> as "the alternative to everything," <b>Garbage</b> pioneered their wildly inventive fusion of pop, heavy guitars, and hip-hop and industrial textures more than two decades ago. Their 1994 debut album--recorded in Madison, Wisconsin, by Shirley Manson, Duke Erikson, Steve Marker, and Butch Vig--made them one of the most acclaimed, adventurous, and best-selling bands of the nineties, and an international phenomenon: double platinum in the UK, US, and Australia, headlining festivals around the globe. Their six studio albums have collectively sold over fifteen million copies worldwide. In 2012, Garbage declared their independence by founding their own label, STUNVOLUME, allowing the band to chart their own course on their own terms. After a new album, <i>Strange Little Birds,</i> and an extensive tour in 2016, the band continues to define a future celebrating differences. <i>This Is the Noise That Keeps Me Awake</i> is their first book.<p>"It's not far into its pink-tinged pages that you realize this is one of those all-too-rare, no-holds-barred rock bios that willingly offers up a full, honest and unadulterated backstage pass into the life of a band.

And so was his bedroom. He was in a beautiful forest sparkling with a fresh blanket of Christmas snow. Up ahead he saw a clearing where a single present sat alone. He walked over to it and read the gift tag.<br><br>To Eddie. What your heart needs most for Christmas.<br><br>Curious, Eddie opened the gift. Inside was a handmade Christmas sweater. Eddie was disappointed, but he was so cold that he decided to put it on. It was a perfect fit. Suddenly, the snow around him swirled in all directions, just as if he were inside his snow globe.<br><br>When the snow cleared, Eddie discovered that he was sledding with his father. They both laughed and hung on tight as the sled jumped off a small hill and soared through the sky.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you having fun, Eddie?&#x201d; his father asked.<br><br>Eddie looked down at his magical Christmas sweater. &#x201c;This is the best day ever!&#x201d; Then Eddie gave his dad a big hug and the snow started to swirl again.<br><br>When it settled, Eddie was sitting with his<br>mother at their kitchen table. They had just finished building a gingerbread house. &#x201c;How did we do?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>Eddie licked some frosting from his fingers and said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re a great team, Mom.&#x201d; He thought about the Christmas sweater he was wearing. Could a simple sweater really have Christmas magic? Suddenly, the snow swirled again.<br><br>When it cleared, Eddie was sitting inside a sleigh with his grandpa.<br><br>&#x201c;Eddie,&#x201d; Grandpa asked, &#x201c;want to take a ride?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Eddie cheered. &#x201c;Do I need anything?&#x201d;<br><br>Grandpa hugged him tight and said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got your Christmas sweater. Looks like you have everything you&#x2019;ll ever need.&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie eyed the candy canes in the sleigh. &#x201c;Grab one,<br>Eddie!&#x201d; With a twinkle in his eye, Grandpa called out to each reindeer by name and yelled, &#x201c;Now dash away, dash away, dash away, all!&#x201d;<br><br>The sleigh lurched forward and Eddie sat up in his bed. He&#x2019;d dreamed the whole night away. It was Christmas morning and the smell of his mother&#x2019;s pancakes filled the house. He jumped out of bed, scampered downstairs . . . and stopped dead in his tracks. Under the tree was the bike he&#x2019;d waited for all year. But instead of running to it, Eddie slowly searched the room with his eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Eddie,&#x201d; his mother asked. &#x201c;Is something wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Go ahead and pinch yourself, son,&#x201d; his father said excitedly. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t a dream. Go jump on your new bike!&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie shook his head. &#x201c;The bike is great, but I was looking for something else.&#x201d;<br><br>His family looked at one another with puzzled faces.<br><br>With all the sincerity in his heart, he explained, &#x201c;I was really hoping to get a Christmas sweater. I mean, a bike is just a bike, but a Christmas sweater can be so much more.&#x201d; <br><br>Eddie&#x2019;s mom crouched down behind the tree and pulled out a single box. It looked familiar. &#x201c;Is this what you&#x2019;re searching for?&#x201d; she asked. Eddie smiled from ear to ear.<br><br>He reached for the box, opened it, and eagerly pulled out his Christmas sweater. He stared at it and then put it on over his pajamas. It was a perfect fit. He felt true warmth for the first time in his life.<br><br>Eddie thought about his dream and about the message on the gift tag.<br><br>What your heart needs most for Christmas.<br><br>It gave him a magical idea.<br><br>He walked over to his mother and gave her the best present in the world&#x2014;the one thing that her heart also needed the most. ...<br><br>A big, warm hug from her son.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Mom,&#x201d; he whispered.<br>&#x201c;I love you.&#x201d;<br><br>As Eddie&#x2019;s father looked on proudly, Grandpa picked up a snow globe and gave it a gentle shake. As the flakes settled, he called out to Eddie and, with a familiar twinkle in his eye, slipped a single candy cane into his grandson&#x2019;s pocket.<br><br>� 2009 Mercury Radio Arts, Inc</p><h2>The J.R.R. Tolkien Audio Collection</h2><p><p>For generations, J.R.R. Tolkien's words have brought to thrilling life a world of hobbits, magic, and historic myth, woken from its foggy slumber within our minds. Here, he tells the tales is his own voice.</p><p>Of historic note, these selections from <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> are based on a tape recording Tolkien made in 1952, which inspired him to continue his own quest to see his vision in print. Also included is a never-published poem, "The Mirror of Galadriel," originally intended for inclusion in the trilogy, yet edited out. And, finally, Tolkien's son, Christopher, reads selections from his father's <em>The Silmarillion, </em>the epic foundation upon which rests the whole of his work.</p></p><p><p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892-1973) was a major scholar of the English language, specializing in Old and Middle English. Twice Professor of Anglo-Saxon (Old English) at the University of Oxford, he also wrote a number of stories, including most famously <em>The Hobbit</em> (1937) and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> (1954-1955), which are set in a pre-historic era in an invented version of the world which he called by the Middle English name of Middle-earth.</p><br><br><p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892-1973) was a major scholar of the English language, specializing in Old and Middle English.

Tolkien, made in the 1950s.The sound quality of the oldest recordings isn't very good, but it's nevertheless interesting to hear Tolkien's characterizations of his own soon-to-be-famous characters. Those expecting Tolkien to sound like a dowdy professor will be surprised when they hear the gusto and bluster he brings to the mighty Tom Bombadil and the sinister glee he injects into the voice of the evil cave-dwelling Gollum. The collection is rounded out by newer recordings of the author's son, Christopher, reading from his father's works.

Preface gives an easy-to-understand introduction to Marxist philosophy. Includes the complete texts of &#34;The Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844&#34;, &#34;The Communist Manifesto&#34;, &#34;Wage Labor and Capital&#34;, and &#34;Critique of the Gotha Program&#34;.</p><p>"A spectre is haunting Europe," Karl Marx and Frederic Engels wrote in 1848, "the spectre of Communism." This new edition of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, commemorating the 150th anniversary of its publication, includes an introduction by renowned historian Eric Hobsbawm which reminds us of the document's continued relevance. Marx and Engels's critique of capitalism and its deleterious effect on all aspects of life, from the increasing rift between the classes to the destruction of the nuclear family, has proven remarkably prescient. Their spectre, manifested in the <i>Manifesto</i>'s vivid prose, continues to haunt the capitalist world, lingering as a ghostly apparition even after the collapse of those governments which claimed to be enacting its principles."A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of Communism." So begins one of history's most important documents, a work of such magnitude that it has forever changed not only the scope of world politics, but indeed the course of human civilization. The Communist Manifesto was written in Friedrich Engels's clear, striking prose and declared the earth-shaking ideas of Karl Marx. Upon publication in 1848, it quickly became the credo of the poor and oppressed who longed for a society "in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all." <br>The Communist Manifesto contains the seeds of Marx's more comprehensive philosophy, which continues to inspire influential economic, political, social, and literary theories. But the Manifesto is most valuable as an historical document, one that led to the greatest political upheaveals of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and to the establishment of the Communist governments that until recently ruled half the globe. <br>This Bantam Classic edition of The Communist Manifesto includes Marx and Engels's historic 1872 and 1882 prefaces, and Engels's notes and prefaces to the 1883 and 1888 editions.</p><h2>Introduction to Christian Ethics: Conflict, Faith, and Human Life</h2><p><p>All Christians read the Bible differently, pray differently, value their traditions differently, and give different weight to individual and corporate judgment. These differences are the basis of conflict. The question Christian ethics must answer, then, is, "What does the good life look like in the context of conflict?"</p><p> In this new introductory text, Ellen Ott Marshall uses the inevitable reality of difference to center and organize her exploration of the system of Christian morality.<br></p><ul><li> What can we learn from Jesus' creative use of conflict in situations that were especially attuned to questions of power?</li><li>What does the image of God look like when we are trying to recognize the divine image within those with whom we are in conflict?</li><li>How can we better explore and understand the complicated work of reconciliation and justice?</li></ul><br>This innovative approach to Christian ethics will benefit a new generation of students who wish to engage the perennial questions of what constitutes a faithful Christian life and a just society.<p></p></p><p><p><b>Ellen Ott Marshall</b> is Associate Professor of Christian Ethics and Conflict Transformation at Candler School of Theology, Emory University. She is the author of <i>Though the Fig Tree Does Not Blossom: Toward a Responsible Theology of Christian Hope</i>; <i>Choosing Peace through Daily Practices</i>; <i>Christians in the Public Square: Faith that Transforms Politics</i> and editor of <i>Conflict Transformation and Religion: Essays on Faith, Power, and Relationship.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Ellen Ott Marshall's new <em>Introduction to Christian Ethics </em>is grounded in the novel and timely claim that &#x2018;to study Christian ethics is to study conflict.&#x2019; Deploying a methodology which is contextual, feminist, and Wesleyan, she masterfully explores major theological affirmations and methodological claims of Christian ethics through examples and case studies, all of which return again and again to conflict. This is an introductory text pitched as overview and demonstration, as illustrative, humble, and self-revealing rather than comprehensive, proud, and distant. Marshall claims that &#x2018;one cannot pursue the Kingdom of God without entering into conflict.&#x2019; She is absolutely right, and this introductory textbook, helps us understand why. Highly recommended.&#x201d; &#x2013;David P. Gushee, Distinguished University Professor of Christian Ethics and Director, Center for Theology &amp; Public Life, Mercer University; author of <em>Still Christian: Following Jesus Out of American Evangelicalism </em></p><br><br><p>If you have been looking for an innovative text to teach introductory Christian ethics, then Ellen Ott Marshall&#x2019;s new book is it. &#x201c;How do we live the good life in the midst of ongoing conflict?&#x201d; Marshalluses conflict as an interpretive lens to explicate and rethink theological concepts, such as imago Dei, sin, and reconciliation and ethical theories, such as teleology, deontology and responsibility. Her keen scholarly insights are also practical insights drawn from experiences of conflict in church and society. With this book, Professor Marshall provides a means to teach our students how to think ethically about and be moral agents who respond faithfully to the ongoing conflict of twenty-first century life in church and society. -- Marcia Y. Riggs, J. Erskine Love Professor of Christian Ethics, Columbia Theological Seminary</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;By acknowledging that conflict is at the heart of the human experience, Marshall offers a radically new and innovative approach to the task of Christian ethics, one that offers creative possibilities for deepening moral reflection. Imaginative, impassioned, practical, and imminently accessible, this book is an essential read.&#x201d; &#x2013; Rebecca Todd Peters, Professor of Religious Studies and Director, Poverty and Social Justice Program, Elon University</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;In a moment when the public meaning of Christianity and Christian moral responsibility couldn't be more contested comes this excellent text by Ellen Ott Marshall. <em>Introduction to Christian Ethics</em>brings us on a journey of careful critical thinking rooted in clear methodology so we may engage the urgent collective question &#x201c;how do we live the good life in the midst of conflict?&#x201d; Marshall doesn't merely ensure her readers take seriously tradition, reason, texts and contexts; she also demonstrates that our engagement of such must include critique and reconstruction for the sake of justice and social transformation. She ably demonstrates how these are part of the social-ethical mission at the heart of the Christian tradition. I am eager to use this work with my own students and excited about what it will enable them to go forth and be and do in the world.&#x201d; &#x2013;Jennifer Harvey, Professor of Religion, Drake University</p></p><h2>Do-It-Yourself Garden Projects and Crafts: 60 Planters, Bird Houses, Lotion Bars, Garlands, and More</h2><p><b>Improve and decorate your garden and home with easy projects and beautiful crafts.

So Ginny takes matters into her own hands...<br><br> Benjamin Ludwig's whip-smart, unforgettable novel is an illuminating look at one girl's journey to find her way home and one of the freshest debuts in years.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of May 2017:</strong> It&#x2019;s the rare novel that has an autistic teenage heroine, and an even rarer novel is one that surprises you on every single page, as <em>Ginny Moon</em> quite emphatically does. Told from the point of view of thirteen-year-old Ginny, this absorbing debut sets at its heart Ginny&#x2019;s obsession with &#x201c;Baby Doll,&#x201d; whom she unwillingly abandoned four years ago when she was taken away from her drug-addicted and abusive birth mother. Ginny fears Baby Doll is still in a suitcase, where she left her when the police separated Ginny from her mother, and Ginny has been testing and breaking the patience of various foster parents in her attempts to reunite with her mother so that Ginny can again take care of Baby Doll. Ginny is not stupid&#x2014;she finds her birth mother on Facebook, steals another student&#x2019;s phone to contact her, and concocts various plans to get back to her Baby Doll with a single-mindedness that is as daring as it is alarming, for Ginny is fully aware that her birth mother will likely again physically abuse her. Ginny&#x2019;s unpredictability keeps the pressure high, and I wondered throughout how this novel could possibly deliver a satisfying conclusion. But Benjamin Ludwig, himself the foster parent of an autistic teen, pulls together the action into a tear-provoking finale that will have you cheering for the stubborn, brave, impulsive, and ultimately heroic Ginny Moon. (Heck, I&#x2019;m getting teary just writing this review.) <em>&#x2014;Adrian Liang, The Amazon Book Review </em>A life-long teacher of English and writing, Benjamin Ludwig lives in New Hampshire with his family. He holds an MAT in English Education and an MFA in Writing. Shortly after he and his wife married they became foster parents and adopted a teenager with autism.

Whether offering insight into the rise in home births, the alarming rise in America&#x2019;s maternal mortality rate, or the history of involuntary sterilization, Karkowsky offers a window into all that pregnancy, labor, and birth can entail&#x2015;birth and joy, but also challenge and loss&#x2015;illustrating the complexity of reproductive life and the systems that surround it. With historical insight and journalistic verve, Karkowsky unpacks what is involved for women, for a family, and for us as a society; and explores what&#x2019;s at risk when these aspects of medicine remain clouded in mystery and misinformation.</p></p><p>Chavi Eve Karkowsky, MD, is a maternal-fetal medicine physician working in New York City.

At its heart, the book is a history of the Soviet Union, the most comprehensive reorganization of human society ever attempted by a nation-state. This is the story of how the agitation of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, two mid-nineteenth-century European thinkers and writers, led to a great and terrible world religion that brought down a mighty empire, consumed the world in conflict, and left in its wake a devastation whose full costs can only now be tabulated.</p><p>As Harvard University professor Richard Pipes shows in <i>Communism: A Brief History</i>, the tragedy of Communism is that its history was anything but brief. For most of the 20th century, it held much of the globe in its fatal grip: The utopian ideology is responsible for nearly 100 million deaths, which is 50 percent more than the number of people killed in the two world wars combined. "Communism was not a good idea that went wrong; it was a bad idea," writes Pipes, who is also the author of <i>The Russian Revolution</i> and <i>Property and Freedom</i>. <p> This compelling little book is a devastating critique of Marxism, Leninism, Stalinism, and everything else that fits under the awful rubric of Communism. It begins by tracing Communism's philosophical origins (it has antecedents in Plato) and then outlines the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Next comes the story of why Communism took root in Russia and not the industrial West, where Marx himself believed it would sprout (answer: the traditions of property rights and the rule of law were too strong). Even in Russia, Communism was not the product of popular demand (in fact, it has never been the product of popular demand anywhere). Instead, it was a top-down revolution imposed on the whole country by a small minority of elites, led by Lenin. The Communists claimed to represent workers, but few workers were actually a part of their movement. Thus, "the Communists had to rule despotically and violently; they could never afford to relax their authority." And they were capable of incredible cruelty: "The so-called purges of the 1930s were a terror campaign that in indiscriminate ferocity and number of victims had no parallel in world history." In 1937 and 1938, for instance, the Soviet rulers of Russia executed an average of 1,000 people per day; the tsarist regime they supplanted, which was often criticized as inhumane, executed less than 4,000 people for political crimes over an 85-year period. </p><p> Though Pipes appropriately spends much time discussing the Soviet Union, he also examines Communism's reception in the West and in developing countries. The book is a concise tour de force. As the cold war fades into history, it is critical not to forget the monstrous legacy of Communism, whose horrible record Pipes lays out on these pages. This is a magnificent book, a wonderful primer on a topic whose importance is difficult to overstate. <i>--John Miller</i></p>&#x201c;In the name of great good, Communism has brought great evil. . . .

Every culture in the world creates hauntings for itself, things that lurk in the shadows and wait for the unwary. Yet, at the same time, there are certain ghost stories and certain forms of haunting that seem to be quintessentially American. This leads us to the story of the Phantom Prom Date. Her story is considered an example of the Hitchhiking Ghost sub-type (see Appendix A for further details on the base legend), but has been expanded into a cautionary tale for teenagers about the dangers of driving recklessly. It is perhaps no coincidence that the Phantom Prom Date first began to walk the roads of America in the early 1950s, when concern for teen driving was at a national high.<br> &nbsp;<br> The most interesting thing about this legend is that it presents a hitchhiking ghost with no specific geographical ties. Unlike Chicago&#x2019;s White Mary or New Hampshire&#x2019;s Lonely John, the Phantom Prom Date can be seen anywhere in North America, and has made appearances in locations as diverse as Florida, Ontario, and the Pacific Northwest. The only American state with no recorded sightings is Hawaii, which fits with the legend&#x2014; how would a ghost whose only means of travel is the highway reach a state surrounded entirely by water?<br> &nbsp;<br> The physical appearance of the Phantom Prom Date may also be relevant. One would expect a legend this far-ranging to present with a dozen different descriptions, but all recorded sightings have included the same details. She is in her mid-teens, with shoulder-length, light brown or dark blonde hair, Caucasian, attractive enough to be noticed without being strikingly beautiful, and wearing a green silk prom dress with matching dress flats. Neither the style of her hair nor the style of her dress changes from report to report; she seems to be caught in the era where she died, forever roaming the highways of America, forever looking for someone who can help her find the way home . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014; <i>On the Trail of the Phantom Prom Date</i>, Professor Laura<br> Moorhead, University of Colorado.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>1973</b><br> <b>The Dead Girl in the Diner</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> THERE&#x2019;S THIS VOCABULARY WORD&#x2014; &#x201c;linear.&#x201d; It means things that happen in a straight line, like highways and essays about what you did on your summer vacation.

Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t sunshine and roses for everybody. My parents were still tightening their belts and pulling up their bootlaces when little Rosie Marshall made the scene, just one more mouth to feed and one more untried heart to break. They wouldn&#x2019;t be feeding me for long. Daddy split when I was eight years old. Me, I made it all the way to 1952, sixteen short years of chances and choices and opportunities. And then it was over.<br> &nbsp;<br> I died on a hot summer night in my junior year of high school, driven off the road by a man who should never have been there. My body was battered almost past recognition by the accident. My spirit fared a little better, sweet sixteen for the rest of time, missing the warm coat of life&#x2019;s embrace.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was alive, and then I wasn&#x2019;t. Someday, they&#x2019;ll say the same thing about everyone. Someday, they&#x2019;ll say the same thing about you.<br> &nbsp;<br> There are a lot of names for people like me, the ones who can&#x2019;t let go, even when the movie&#x2019;s over and the credits finish rolling. Specter, haunt, phantom . . . and my personal favorite, the sweet and simple &#x201c;ghost.&#x201d; &#x201c;Ghost&#x201d; is a lot like &#x201c;linear&#x201d;: it&#x2019;s a word that doesn&#x2019;t fuck around pretending to be something it&#x2019;s not. There are even a lot of names for me in specific, names that try to dance around the word &#x201c;Rose.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m the phantom prom date, the woman at the diner, the girl in the green silk gown, and the walking girl of Route 42. But most of all, I&#x2019;m the ghost of Sparrow Hill Road. Rosie Marshall. Just one more girl who raced and lost in the hand of the forest, the shade of the hill, on the hairpin curves of that damned deadly hill.<br> &nbsp;<br> People call me a lot of things these days. You can call me Rose.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now come with me.<br> &nbsp;<br> ~<br> &nbsp;<br> The truck stop air has that magical twang that you only ever find in roadside dives that have had time to fully merge with their environment. It&#x2019;s a mixture of baked asphalt, diesel fumes, hot exhaust, and hotter exhaustion. The smell of grease and lard- based piecrusts join the symphony as I get closer to the obligatory diner, the charmingly named FORK YOU GRILL. The smell of ashes and lilies runs under it all, cold and enticing as the grave, and I know that I am where I am supposed to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> My fingers are cold. My fingers are always cold, and the coat I&#x2019;m wearing is too thin to really warm them up. I got it from a twenty-something on his way to California to be a rock musician. He said it belonged to his little sister. From the smell of the perfume permanently bonded to the denim, she was only his little sister if his little sister was moonlighting as a prostitute. But who am I to judge? I traded the coat for a backseat quickie, and now my hands are cold no matter how far I shove them into my hooker&#x2019;s-coat pockets, and I can taste the truck stop air. Being dead is one of those things that really teaches you how to be glad to be alive.<br> &nbsp;<br> The distant drone of cars on the highway accompanies me across the parking lot, my shoes crunching on the glass and gravel. The sound of the jukebox slithers out to meet me as I open the diner door, Top 40 country hits with all the passion of a dead dog on the side of the highway. I keep on going. I&#x2019;m not here for the music.<br> &nbsp;<br> The air inside the diner is hot and dry and sweet with coffee and apple pie and the distant ghosts of greasy breakfasts past. Half a dozen truckers sit belly- up to the counter on stools twice the size of standard; this is a place that stays alive on the trucker trade, and isn&#x2019;t ashamed of that reality. Another half- dozen patrons are sprinkled around the place, seated haphazardly at booths and tables. That tells me what the deal is even before I see the hand- written sign inviting me to &#x201c;PLZ SEAT YOURSELF, B RIGHT WITH U.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> From the expressions of the folks who aren&#x2019;t too tired to enjoy their food, the staff here cooks better than they spell. That&#x2019;s for the best. Killing your customers with food poisoning isn&#x2019;t a good way to stay in business.<br> &nbsp;<br> There&#x2019;s something not-quite-right about one of the truckers, a barrel-chested man with a neat little goatee and the hands of an artist. He has those artist&#x2019;s hands wrapped tight around a coffee mug, stealing heat through the porcelain like a small child stealing cookies from the cookie jar. Most of the eyes in the diner skitter right off me, frightened mice catching the scent of a cat, but not him. He doesn&#x2019;t look at me for long, but when he does, he <i>sees </i>me.<br> &nbsp;<br> That, even more than the scent of ash and lilies lingering in the air around him, tells me he&#x2019;s the one I&#x2019;ve come here for; he&#x2019;s the one that called me, made me give up a perfectly good westward ride to come to this middle-of-nowhere dive with nothing but the coat on my back and the frostbite on my fingers. I can&#x2019;t save him, but I know him.<br> &nbsp;<br> At least, I know his kind. He&#x2019;s in the process of sliding into the space between two Americas. This one, where the air tastes like apple pie and the jukebox plays the Top 40, and a quieter, colder America, one where the kisses pretty girls sometimes give never taste of anything but empty rooms and broken promises. He&#x2019;s falling into my America, and there&#x2019;s not a damn thing to be done about it. It&#x2019;s not the sort of trip that you recover from. If the scent around him were rosemary and sugary perfume, maybe, but ashes and lilies . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> There&#x2019;s nothing to be done. The record on the jukebox changes as I walk toward the counter. The Country Gentlemen, &#x201c;Bringing Mary Home.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I hate it when the inanimate pretends to have a sense of humor.<br> &nbsp;<br> ~<br> &nbsp;<br> He looks up when I sit down, a flicker of interest showing in his eyes. They&#x2019;re the color of sun- faded denim, all their darkness bleached out by the road. The blue-eyed boys have always been my weakness. I meet that brief look with a smile that&#x2019;s more sincere than I intended, flashing white teeth between candy-apple-red lips.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s hard to dress for the truck stop circuit. Can&#x2019;t be too wholesome or they&#x2019;re afraid to even talk to you; there&#x2019;s too much of a chance that you&#x2019;re some sort of lure set out by the local cops. Sandra Dee doesn&#x2019;t play with the long-haul boys. Neither does her evil twin: going too far the other way makes you look like you&#x2019;re just another lot lizard, worth the price of a blow job, but not worth the cost of conversation. So here I am in flannel shirt under denim jacket over too-tight wife-beater tank top, faded jeans worn as thin as paper, hiking boots, and makeup that would verge on slutty if it wasn&#x2019;t so inexpertly applied.<br> &nbsp;<br> I know my audience. I&#x2019;ve had a lot of time to study it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; I say, with a questioning lilt that blurs the remnants of my accent, blotting out the route signs that might lead back to my origins. &#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Rose. Do you, um, come here often?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He looks my way again. His eyes are kind. That makes it a little easier. We&#x2019;re about to get to know each other real well, and it&#x2019;s better when their eyes are kind. &#x201c;Let me stop you right there, honey. You&#x2019;re way too young for me. Hell, you&#x2019;re way too young to be out here at all. Don&#x2019;t you have a home to go to?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not for a long time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I see.&#x201d; Disapproval overtakes the kindness like the sun going down&#x2014; but the disapproval isn&#x2019;t directed at me, and that makes what has to happen next easier still. &#x201c;When&#x2019;s the last time you ate?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> This time I don&#x2019;t have to force myself to smile. &#x201c;Too long ago.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s the truth. I&#x2019;m always hungry&#x2014; one more consequence of being what I am&#x2014; and I have to follow certain rules. If the living choose to feed me while I&#x2019;m material, the food has flavor and substance. If I try to feed myself, it&#x2019;s only air and ashes, like chewing on nothing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Would you mind if I bought you a burger?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not at all.&#x201d; I slide over a little on my stool, trying to make myself comfortable. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re going to buy me a burger, can you tell me your name, maybe? I like to know who I&#x2019;m thanking.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Larry. Larry Vibber.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pleased to meet you, Larry.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pleased to meet you, too, Rose,&#x201d; he says, and laughs as he waves for the waitress to come over to our little stretch of counter. I&#x2019;d feel guilty, if I had anything to feel guilty about. There are worse ways to spend your last night on Earth than buying dinner for a stranger in a diner, and if I wasn&#x2019;t here, he&#x2019;d be spending this time alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> ~<br> &nbsp;<br> The burger tastes like Heaven on a sesame seed bun, assuming that Heaven comes with ketchup and raw onions. If Larry wonders why I ask him to pass me the condiments before I dump them on, he doesn&#x2019;t say anything about it. The coffee is even better than the burger, and the apple pie is so damn good I could cry. The living don&#x2019;t know how lucky they are.<br> &nbsp;<br> Larry finishes his food well before I do. After that, he just watches me demolishing my meal, until I&#x2019;m chasing crumbs with the tip of my index finger and wishing I&#x2019;d thought to chew a little slower. I wish that every time. I never do it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then Larry clears his throat, and I turn to look at him again. He smiles, weakly. &#x201c;I was thinking, Rose . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A girl your age shouldn&#x2019;t be alone in a place like this. Now, I know you don&#x2019;t have much reason to trust me, and I&#x2019;ll understand if you don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a good idea, but I&#x2019;m rolling for Detroit tonight. I&#x2019;d be happy to take you along, get you to a place where maybe . . . you could find somewhere to stay.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Oh, Larry. He won&#x2019;t be getting anywhere near Detroit tonight. I know that, I&#x2019;ve known it since I saw him across the diner, but that doesn&#x2019;t matter, because this is what happens; this is what I came here for. I push my plate away, and if he sees that my smile is painted on over sorrow, he&#x2019;s polite enough not to say anything. He&#x2019;s trying to help. Most truckers are essentially good people, living one of the few vagabond lifestyles that&#x2019;s survived into this changing world, where it gets harder every year to keep from putting down roots. They help each other when they can, and they like to be seen as shining knights riding dragons instead of snow- white chargers.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; I tug my borrowed coat tighter, smelling old perfume, old sex, old lies. My lies are some of the oldest of them all, but I tell them for the very best of reasons. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d really appreciate a ride.&#x201d; Rides are what I don&#x2019;t live for, after all.<br> &nbsp;<br> The waitress who takes Larry&#x2019;s money looks at me a little too hard, a little too intently. She knows me. She&#x2019;s deep enough into the twilight Americas to know me, but she&#x2019;s still in the shallows. She&#x2019;s still too close to the daylight layers to understand <i>why </i>she knows, or what, exactly, it is that she&#x2019;s seeing. I flash her a smile. She steps backward, counts Larry&#x2019;s change wrong twice, and finally&#x2014; once she has the register closed again&#x2014; flees into the back.<br> &nbsp;<br> She won&#x2019;t be here much longer. She&#x2019;ll go back to the daylight, leave this blacktop twilight to the people who can breathe its air and not worry about suffocating. That&#x2019;s good. People like her should get out while they still can, to make up for all the people who never get the chance.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then Larry leads me out of the diner, out into the night, and the waitress doesn&#x2019;t matter anymore. We&#x2019;re on the road again, and there&#x2019;s nothing that can save us now.</p><h2>xxxHOLiC Omnibus 7</h2><p>CAGED BUTTERFLY<br><br> The longer Watanuki resides over the shop, the stronger he gets and the more he learns to rely on his friends in the way his friends have relied on him.

In addition to providing clues to status, profession, and/or geographic origin, textiles were a crucial element in the economies of many countries and cities.<br> &nbsp;<br> Much of what is known about medieval fashion is gleaned from the pages of manuscripts, which serve as a rich source of imagery. This volume provides a detailed look at both the actual fabrics and composition of medieval clothing as well as the period&#x2019;s attitude toward fashion through an exploration of illuminated manuscripts in the collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum. The last portion of the book is dedicated to the depiction of clothing in biblical times and the ancient world as seen through a medieval lens. Throughout, excerpts from literary sources of the period help shed light on the perceived role and function of fashion in daily life.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Margaret Scott is the former head of the History of Dress Department at the Courtauld Institute of Art, London, and a world-renowned authority on medieval clothing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Margaret Scott&#x2019;s beautiful volume <i>Fashion in the Middle Ages</i> . . . could almost be read as a guidebook for what to wear to one&#x2019;s next medieval-inspired outing . . .&#x201c;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)</p><h2>Please Don&#39;t Say You Need Me: Biblical Answers for Codependency</h2><p>Please Don&#x2019;t Say You Need Me. . . is a common plea voiced by people trapped in unhealthy, codependent relationships. Confused by their conflicting emotions, they feel trapped between wanting to love and care for someone else and yet, at the same time, needing to escape from that person&#x2019;s intense and suffocating demands for self-esteem.Jan Silvious offers practical, biblical answers for those dealing with codependency&#x2015;actually, people-dependency&#x2015;that can exist between mates, siblings, parents and children, and friends.� Who is the codependent person?� What is a codependent relationship?� What role does guilt play in a codependent relationship?� Can Christians be codependent?Jan Silvious answers these questions and shows readers how to identify and break the cycle of a codependent relationship in a loving, scriptural manner. Here is insight, hope, and encouragement for replacing unhealthy ways of relating with a new approach that can bring balance and wholeness.</p><p>Jan Silvious has years of experience as a counselor and Bible teacher.

The sad voice was too familiar. In half-apologetic, half-desperate tones she said, &#39;You have got to tell me if I&#39;m going crazy.&#39; For nine years, my friend Margaret had called periodically to say her adulterous, abusive husband was once again trying to charm his way into her affections while continuing to live in adultery with his secretary. All it took from him was a kind word or a tender touch, and momentarily, the rage within her was silenced as she hoped against hope that maybe this time they would salvage their marriage. During their lives together, he had threatened her, lied to her, abandoned her, and been unfaithful to her. Yet whenever I would suggest that we are not intended to live continuously in such relationships, she would whimper, &#39;But, if I don&#39;t have him, I&#39;ll be all alone. Just having him part of the time is better than not having him at all.&#39; For years her drama has had the same story line. He cheats, she gets angry and threatens to leave. He repents with sweet words and plays the role of devoted husband. She convinces herself he has changed. He cheats, she gets angry, and the cycle starts all over again. Each time, her spirit dies a little more, and yet she can&#39;t find a way of escape. Case Two The attractive businesswoman took me by surprise as she told the bizarre tale of chasing her roommate around the block, begging her to come home after they had quarreled. Lynn poured out her feelings of rage and disappointment about her friend Diane. Lynn&#39;s childlike brown eyes looked pouty as she detailed Diane&#39;s inconsiderate actions toward her. This roommate, with whom she had shared everything, was slighting her, spending too much time with another woman at work. Their frequent arguments always seemed to be ignited by the failure of one to meet the other&#39;s need for companionship. The weekend had been a repetition of so many others. Lynn had wanted the two of them to go to a movie, but Diane already had made plans with her friend at work. The nagging and accusations began, and in an outburst of frustration, forty-year-old Diane stormed out of the house, vowing never to return. Lynn ran out after her, begging her to talk. Through tears, Lynn promised that she would be better if Diane would just come home. Case Three Many years ago I met a wonderful friend. We clicked immediately. We enjoyed doing many of the same things. We loved to talk and dream, and we liked the way our friendship felt. It became a real comfort zone for both of us. Whenever I needed to talk, she was there. Whenever she wanted to go somewhere, I went with her. The easy camaraderie and the heady feeling of immediately becoming &#39;best friends&#39; flattered our egos. My friend needed me and I loved being needed. Every protective, encouraging thing I did was received as a precious gift. Her gratitude was unending, and I loved it. Then one day things changed. I can still remember the dark cloud that quietly floated across my comfort zone. Someone else had come on the scene. She was bright, bubbly, and loved to do fun things with my friend. It soon became evident that I was not needed very much anymore. At first my reaction was one of slight annoyance, similar to the response you have to the buzzing of a mosquito in your ear. Then my feelings became irritated. The irksome bug had bitten me. As the welt of anger and irritation grew, I realized I had been attacked by jealousy. That made me furious with myself and even more furious with my friend and her friend. Soon the welt was scratched raw and a full-blown infection set in. It didn&#39;t take long to spread, and ugly open sores appeared for all to see. The healing of those infected areas took a long time because the jealousy episode was just one of many irrational, destructive scenes to be played out in our relationship. Today, the sores are healed, but the scars remain as silent reminders of an agonizing time when a relationship controlled my emotions and consumed energy that should have been more profitably given to other relationships and activities. Codependency While the circumstances differ in each of these cases, the root problem is the same: codependency. This root grabs hold of the soil of your heart so firmly that pulling it up and destroying it is a phenomenal task. It takes time, determination, and an unshakable faith in God and his power to intervene in your life. What is codependency? Simply put, it is a relationship between two people who allow one another&#39;s behavior to profoundly affect the other. In an attempt to &#39;feel good&#39; about himself, a participant in a codependency will try to control the physical, emotional, and spiritual behavior of the other person, or he will compromise his own physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being for the sake of the other person. Both the control and the compromise are predicated on the belief that this relationship must exist for personal esteem, security, and intimacy. This is a very clinical description of a heart-rending, destructive situation that kills many relationships and breaks the spirits of people who had nothing but good intentions when they first met. Unfortunately, one of the laws of human relationship is if we look to another person for security, intimacy, and esteem and can&#39;t receive enough, the relationship will crumble. No one can sustain the unrealistic expectations of another, no matter how dear that person is, if he feels responsible to give the impossible. Eventually the intense demands will crush the relationship&#39;s life and spontaneity, leaving only obligation and resentment. And for the individual who feels so desperately needy, disappointment after disappointment will set up a track record for failure in every significant relationship. Misery will only compound as his search for security, intimacy, and esteem goes on.</p><h2>Weather Words and What They Mean (New Edition)</h2><p><b><b>The perfect introduction to how we talk and think about the weather</b></b><br><br>Everyone talks about the weather, but what does it all mean?

The book provides novel ways to approach the challenges that plague qualitative researchers across the social sciences&#x2014;how to conceptualize causality, how to manage the variation of observations, and how to leverage the researcher&#x2019;s community of inquiry. <i>Abductive Analysis</i> is a landmark work that shows how a pragmatist approach provides a productive and fruitful way to conduct qualitative research.</p></p><p><b>Iddo Tavory</b>&nbsp;is assistant professor of sociology at New York University. Tavory won the 2016 Lewis A. Coser Award for Theoretical Agenda-Setting from the ASA Theory Section.&#x201c;This is a well-crafted, beautifully written, and nicely organized book that seeks to take the task of qualitative social science methods&#x2015;especially ethnographic methods in anthropology and sociology&#x2015;to new levels of sophistication.&#x201d; (Sharon Kaufman <i>University of California, San Francisco</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In&nbsp;<i>Abductive Analysis</i>, Iddo Tavory and Stefan Timmermans make a case that the thought of pragmatist philosopher Charles S. Peirce&#x2015;specifically, his theories of hypothetical reasoning and semiotics&#x2015;can be used to guide and improve qualitative research. Every qualitatively-minded sociologist should consider their strong, well-crafted argument.&#x201d; (Neil Gross <i>University of British Columbia</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In this ground-breaking book, Tavory and Timmermans open a new direction for qualitative inquiry that cuts across current internal divisions and debates.&nbsp; By reframing the logic and process of making sense of data within a pragmatic approach, they give new life to the craft of theorizing. Thoughtful and intellectually exciting, <i>Abductive Analysis</i> is both inspired and inspiring.&#x201d; (Diane Vaughan <i>Columbia University</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Thick description is no longer enough! Tacking back and forth from data to theorizing that data, thoughtful and systematic abduction enables the creative unfolding of a project, opening the researcher to precious moments of analytic surprise. <i>Abductive Analysis</i> is a major contribution to both the pragmatist renaissance and the transnational turn toward theorizing in qualitative research.&#x201d; (Adele Clarke <i>University of California, San Francisco</i>)</p><h2>Damodaran on Valuation: Security Analysis for Investment and Corporate Finance</h2><p>"Aswath Damodaran is simply the best valuation teacher around.

Throughout the Muslim world, it is met with hostility, where state punishments range from hefty fines to the death penalty. Likewise, numerous scholars and commentators maintain that the Qur&#x2019;an and Hadith rule unambiguously against same-sex relations.<br> <br> This pioneering study argues that there is far more nuance to the matter than most believe. In its narrative of Lot, the Qur&#x2019;an could be interpreted as condemning lust rather homosexuality. While some Hadith are fiercely critical of homosexuality, some are far more equivocal. This is the first book length treatment to offer a detailed analysis of how Islamic scripture, jurisprudence, and Hadith, can not only accommodate a sexually sensitive Islam, but actively endorse it.</p><p>Scott Kugle is the first Muslim to publish widely on the issue of homosexuality and Islam. An independent research scholar in Islamic studies, he has previously held positions at Duke University, the University of Cape Town, and Swarthmore College."A tour-de-force. Presents tricky problems in a straightforward way, without either intimidating readers or dumbing down the analysis.

Suddenly he was confronted with the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community (GLBT) firsthand. And he was compelled to understand how he could reconcile his friends to his faith. In an attempt to answer that question, he and his wife relocated to Boystown, a predominantly GLBT community in Chicago. And from his experience and wrestling has come his book, <em>Love Is an Orientation,</em> a work which elevates the conversation between Christianity and the GLBT community, moving the focus from genetics to gospel, where it really belongs. Why are so many people who are gay wary of people who are Christians? Do GLBT people need to change who they are? Do Christians need to change what they believe? <em>Love Is an Orientation</em> is changing the conversation about sexuality and spirituality, and building bridges from the GLBT community to the Christian community and, more importantly, to the good news of Jesus Christ.</p><p>Andrew Marin is President and Founder of The Marin Foundation (themarinfoundation.org). He is author of the award winning book <i>Love Is an Orientation: Elevating the Conversation with the Gay Community</i> (2009), its interactive DVD curriculum (2011), the ebook <i>Our Last Option: How a New Approach to Civility can Save the Public Square</i> (2013), and the forthcoming <i>Us Versus Us: The Untold Story of Religion &amp; the LGBT Community</i> (June 2016). He blogs at patheos.com/blogs/loveisanorientation, is a regular contributor to a variety of media outlets, and frequently lectures at universities around the world. Since 2010 Andrew has been asked by the United Nations to advise their various agencies on issues of bridging opposing worldviews, civic engagement, and Christian involvement in reconciliation. For twelve years he lived in the LGBT Boystown neighborhood of Chicago, and is currently based St. Andrews, Scotland, researching and teaching at the University of St. Andrews earning his PhD in Divinity.

He covers all the main types of endgames and typical thinking methods, and so equips readers with all the skills needed to excel in this vital phase of the game up to good club level and beyond.<br> <br>The endgame is the stage of the game where precision is most important, and where errors are punished most drastically. It is also deceptive: many endgame positions look too simple to require prior knowledge, but yet contain fiendish concealed pitfalls that can reverse the result of the game on the spot.

John Nunn could not be better qualified: he is a battle-hardened grandmaster of top-level over-the-board chess and a solving world champion.

Exploring three modern-day manifestations of Fate, he shows how psychic energy from family patterns, cultural influences, generational legacy, and global evolution inform our self-concept every day, and how they often block our highest potential and &#x201c;Fate&#x201d; us to challenging circumstances and relationships. But, he reveals, these Fated encounters are actually the keys to our unlived life. Each chapter maps our psyche and unravels the mysterious connections of Fate, Free Will, and Destiny, transforming our Fate into Destiny and our limitations into gifts. </p><p>Through this seminal work based on years of experience, discover how we&#x2019;ve made two fundamental agreements with the Universe as part of our Heroic Journey&#x2014;one with Fate and the other with Destiny. As we learn to dance with these two forces, they become two voices challenging and beckoning us to discover our ultimate purpose&#x2014;the primary task of the modern-day Hero and Heroine; and in the process, serve to unleash the power of our Soul in delivering grace to the world.</p></p><p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Ohotto </strong>is a renowned writer, teacher, and professional intuitive.

But she faces her biggest challenge yet in the third and final installment of the Zita adventures. Wrongfully imprisoned on a penitentiary planet, Zita has to plot the galaxy's greatest jailbreak before the evil prison warden can execute his plan of interstellar domination!</p></p><p><p>Ben Hatke's first graphic novel was <i>Zita the Spacegirl</i>. He has published comics stories in the Flight series as well as <i>Flight Explorer</i>. In addition to writing and drawing comics, he also paints in the naturalist tradition and, occasionally, performs one-man fire shows.<i> Return of Zita the Spacegirl</i> is his most recent entry in the New York Times Best-Selling <i>Zita </i>trilogy. </p><p>Hatke lives and works in the Shenandoah Valley with his wife and their boisterous pack of daughters.</p>Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Hatke wraps up this delightful series by neatly tying together all three books. While each volume can be read independently and thoroughly enjoyed solo, the experience of reading the trilogy nicely frames the wider story arc. Zita, now stripped of her possessions, including her signature green cape, remains spunky and feisty. Relegated to a dungeon for her alleged crimes, she meets two unlikely cellmates: a pile of rags, and a rotting skeleton who intones "Eye-spy with my little socket." Cinematic influences are evident throughout, from the opening panoramic scenes to the Evil Dungeon Lord with powers reminiscent of the Sith. The author's wit and comic timing sparkle in this adventure. His motley collection of characters is an absolute delight, and each of their humorous exchanges are spot-on. Readers will be amused by their foibles, and by the text's humor that is gentle, and never vicious. Kids will revel in the wordplay; clever use of language abounds, especially in a discussion on the use of "hallway" vs. "corridor" and when one evildoer explains that the hand signals for quotation marks are the "Universal sign for 'you're actually supposed to kill her." Fans of the young heroine will undoubtedly cheer for this continuation of Zita's saga and eagerly hope that the final page signals further episodes. Back matter including artwork and the story's origins are a bonus.&#x2014;Barbara M. Moon, Suffolk Cooperative Library System, Bellport, NY</p><h2>Veneficium: Magic, Witchcraft and the Poison Path</h2><p>In many esoteric traditions, there exists an iconic or linguistic corollary between the concepts of &#x2018;poisoner&#x2019; and &#x2018;sorcerer&#x2019;,<br>suggesting a sinistral magical kinship. Indeed, the use of plant, animal and mineral toxins is a strand of magic originating in remotest antiquity and reaching the present day. Beyond its mundane function as an agent of corporeal harm, poisons have also served as gateways of religious ecstasy, occult knowledge, and sensorial aberration, as well as the basis of cures. Allied with Samael, the fallen serpent-angel of first transgression whose Hebrew name in some translations is &#x2018;Venom of God&#x2019;, this facet of magic wends through the rites of ancient Sumer and Egypt, penetrating European Necromancy, Alchemy, the arcane the rites of the Witches&#x2019; Sabbath, and modern-day folk magic. <br>VENEFICIUM concerns the intersection of magic and poison. Of particular note to this study are the herbs of the so-called &#x2018;Devil&#x2019;s Garden&#x2019;, which bear relation to the allied witchcraft concepts of the Graal of Midnight, the Witches&#x2019; Supper, and the flying ointment of the witches which has exerted fascination over scholars, historians, and practitioners alike. Beyond consideration of the toxicological dimensions of magical power, the related threads of astral and philosophical poisons are also examined, and their resonance and dissonance with magical practice explored. VENEFICIUM will be of interest to students of magic, witchcraft, alchemy, botanical folklore, medicine, and occult pharmacology.</p><p>Daniel A. Schulke is the author of several works concerning magic, sorcery, and the occult dimensions of plants. In particular, his work concentrates on the vital mystical communion between magical practitioner and the spirit world, as extant in folk magic and charming traditions worldwide. His articles on these subjects have appeared in the occult journals STARFIRE, ABRAXAS, and THE CAULDRON.</p><h2>Hand Quilting with Alex Anderson: Six Projects for First-Time Hand Quilters (Quilting Basics S)</h2><p>Learn how to quilt in all directions and customize your stitch.

In it, David reports that by the early 2000s, his marriage was so painful that he and his wife had just one thing in common: contempt for each other.</p> <p>Today, he and his wife are extremely happy together not because of marriage therapy, but because they came to know and fully embraced the Catholic Church s teachings on marriage.</p> <p>Many people who encounter the Church s teachings are shocked by their rigor. Yet the Church offers much more than rules about sexual restraint; she offers a way to make marriage into something supernatural, even mystical.</p> <p>Here Dr. Anders shares his personal discovery and offers a robust defense of the Church s teaching on marriage even the most controversial topics of divorce, remarriage, gay marriage, and contraception.</p> <p>With the Church s teachings and the writings of the saints as his guide, he also offers practical, time-tested ways to live in peace despite an unhappy marriage, the value of suffering, and ways to overcome reluctance to forgive grave offenses.</p> <p>In a culture that breaks apart marriages and undermines human dignity, Dr. David Anders offers a hope-filled alternative for those who live moral and spiritual lives in union with Christ and His Church.</p></p><p>Dr. David Anders is a host of the popular radio and television program, <i>Called to Communion</i>, aired on EWTN Global Catholic Network.

That question is explored and answered in Randy Maxwell's If My People Pray, a book infused with a passion for prayer as God's chosen method for establishing His kingdom through us and supplying our greatest needs. <p>Prayer is so much more than spiritual discipline or pious exercise. In these pages, you'll be given unlimited resources. The personal and practical insights gleaned from this book will challenge you to respond to god's eleventh-hour call to pray as never before. </p><p>"Every several months I read a book on prayer or how to pray, but Brother Maxwell's book caused me anew to want to pray and to lead others to a deeper prayer experience."-- Lenard D. Jaecks </p><p>"I hated to put it down.... It will take the type of praying [Randy] speaks about to finish the tremendous challenge Christ has placed on us. I highly recommend it to every church member." ---Owen A. Troy, Jr. </p><p>"This book is a long time coming. The only other thing I could recommend better than reading If My People Pray is actually praying. At a time when the church needs something to awaken it, I can't think of anything more than this book." ---Clifford Goldstein</p></p><h2>Stuntman!: My Car-Crashing, Plane-Jumping, Bone-Breaking, Death-Defying Hollywood Life</h2><p>Yep that's me, Hal Needham, on the cover doing a fire stunt. When you're on fire you don't dare breathe because if you do, you'll suck those flames right down your throat. I was Hollywood's highest paid stuntman so I should know.<br><br>I wrecked hundreds of cars, fell from tall buildings, got blown up, was dragged by horses, and along the way broke 56 bones, my back twice, punctured a lung and knocked out a few teeth...I hung upside down by my ankles under a bi-plane in <i>The Spirit of St. Louis</i>, jumped between galloping horses in <i>Little Big Man</i>, set a world record for a boat stunt on <i>Gator</i>, jumped a rocket powered pick-up truck across a canal for a GM commercial, was the first human to test the car airbag-and taught John Wayne how to <i>really </i>throw a movie punch.<br><br>Life also got exciting outside of the movie business. I had my Ferrari stolen right from under my nose, flew in a twin-engine Cessna with a passed out pilot, rescued the cast and crew from a Russian invasion in Czechoslovakia, and once took six flight attendants on a date. I owned the Skoal-Bandit NASCAR race team, the sound-barrier breaking Budweiser Rocket Car and drove a souped-up, fake ambulance in a "little" cross-country race called <i>The Cannonball Run</i>, which became the movie I directed by the same name. Oh yeah, I also directed <i>Smokey and the Bandit</i>, <i>Hooper</i> and several other action/comedy movies that I liked a bunch. <br><br>I was a sharecropper's son from the hills of Arkansas who became a Hollywood stuntman. That journey was a tough row to hoe. I continually risked my life but that was the career I chose. I was never late to the set and did whatever I had to do to get the job done.<br><br>Hollywood's not all sunglasses and autographs. Let me tell you a few stories...</p><p>Hal Needham's career has included work on 4,500 television episodes and 310 feature films. He directed 10 features, including the classics <i>Smokey and the Bandit</i>, <i>Hooper</i>, and <i>The</i> <i>Cannonball Run</i>. He set trends in movies (the first director to show outtakes during end credits) and NASCAR (the first team owner to use telemetry technology). His Skoal-Bandit race team was one of the most popular NASCAR teams ever - second only to that of The King, Richard Petty. Hal set Guinness World Records and was the financier and owner of the Budweiser Rocket Car (now on display in the Smithsonian Museum), the first land vehicle to break the sound barrier - travelling at 739.666 mph. The highest paid stuntman in the world, he has broken fifty-six bones and his back (twice), was the first human to test the car airbag, and has fought for the respect and recognition that stuntmen and stuntwomen deserve for their contribution to the world of moviemaking. His many awards include an Emmy and an Academy Award.Needham worked more than 40 years in Hollywood as a stuntman who filled in for John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Dustin Hoffman, and Burt Reynolds. Given the exciting and dangerous jobs he performed wrangling horses, staging fights, doing "high falls," and crashing cars, Needham has plenty of material, and he writes like a guy telling stories at a bar, laying out one anecdote after another about 1960s and '70s directors and big-time actors. Of course, as a thrice married, hard-living stuntman who was not only Reynolds's stunt-double but also his best friend, Needham has his share of fun and not-so-dirty little secrets that he doles out in a playful prose that makes it obvious that no matter how serious he took his job, he knew how to enjoy life.

He was a man of many facets, of countless passageways that ran through an intricate mind. His magnum opus is a reflection of this, a classic work that stands as one of the most complex, multi-layered novels ever written in any genre. Today the novel is more popular than ever, with new readers continually discovering it and telling their friends to pick up a copy. It has been translated into dozens of lan-guages and has sold almost 20 million copies. Herbert wrote more than twenty other novels, including Hellstrom&#x2019;s Hive, The White Plague, The Green Brain, and The Dosadi Experiment. During his life, he received great acclaim for his sweeping vision and the deep philosophical underpinnings in his writings. His life is detailed in the Hugo-nominated biography Dreamer of Dune, by Brian Herbert. BILL RANSOM has published six novels, six poetry collections, and numerous short stories and articles. Learning the Ropes (Utah State University Press), a collection of poetry, short fiction and essays, was billed as &#x201c;a creative autobiography.&#x201d; His poetry received two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, and his short fiction has appeared in Sunday editions of major newspapers across the country and was chosen three times for the PEN/NEA Syndicated Fiction Project, billed as &#x201c;The Pulitzer Prize of the Short Story.&#x201d; Bill has been nominated for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, and his most recent collection is The Woman and the War Baby, from Blue Begonia Press. He pioneered the Poetry-in-the-Schools program for the National Endowment for the Arts in the 1970s. He worked as a firefighter and advanced life-support emer-gency medical technician in Washington state, and in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua in their civil wars through the 1980s. These experiences informed much of his writing. He recently retired as Academic Dean of Curriculum at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington and makes his home on the Washington coast.</p><h2>Fables: The Wolf Among Us Vol. 2</h2><p>Bigby Wolf has been around for a good long while, and he&#x2019;s investigated pretty much every crime imaginable&#x2014;but even an immortal Fable like him can still stumble across a once-in-a-lifetime case.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the sheriff of the magical New York City neighborhood known as Fabletown, Bigby is hot on the trail of the killer who beheaded a princess and then unleashed a horde of gangsters and monsters to cover his tracks.<br> &nbsp;<br> But even as Bigby reels from attempts on his life and watches his trail of suspects go cold, an old evil reappears to wreak havoc once more.

For the word is very near to you. Where life forever holds gentle sway over death, where people are human with the same grace that a willow is a willow, where the struggle and the yearning between male and female is at last resolved.... It is to begin with, all inside us."<br>&#x2015;from the Introduction</p><p>"In the past decade I've read <em>Honey from the Rock</em> at least half a dozen times. Every time I read it I wonder if I have ever read it before. Either it keeps changing, or I do. Maybe it&#x2019;s both.... As someone told me: 'Lawrence Kushner is a mystic. He gives you flashes of insight.'"<br>&#x2015;from the Publisher&#x2019;s Preface to the Anniversary Edition</p></blockquote><p></p></p><p>Lawrence Kushner describes <i>Honey from the Rock</i> as "an attempt to synthesize some of the world view of classical Jewish mysticism, or Kabbala, with the ordinary life experience of its author." In the introduction, Kushner also explains that the book "works best, not as a primer on Kabbalah, nor as a glimpse into the private places of a liberal Rabbi, but as a means of enticing the reader to allow a Kabbalistic world view to inform his or her everyday life." After providing that explanation of his project, Kushner's book takes flight. He begins: "There is a place as far from here as breathing out is from breathing in. <i>For the word is very near you</i>.... Where life forever holds gentle sway over death, where people are human with the same grace that a willow is a willow, where the struggle and the yearning between male and female is at last resolved. It is, to begin with, all inside us." There are no false words in this book, no straining logic, no lazy vagueness, no awkward didacticism. <i>Honey from the Rock</i> walks through 10 different "gates" to Jewish mysticism, from the "Wilderness" of preparation for prayer to the "Higher Worlds" of which some are granted glimpses. Each chapter will help clarify your vision a little more and teach you to become a little more present. Each one will also make you smile. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p><strong>Lawrence Kushner</strong>, author, lecturer and spiritual leader, is regarded as one of the most creative religious thinkers and writers in America.

She lives in Richmond, Virginia.</p><b>Praise for <i>Lower Ed</i>:</b><br>"The best book yet on the complex lives and choices of for-profit students."<br> <b><i>The New York Times Book Review </i></b><br><br>"Cottom does a good job of making the name <i>Lower Ed</i> stick, and she makes a solid case for reviewing the entire system of higher education for openness of opportunity."<br> <b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>"In <i>Lower Ed</i> McMillan Cottom is at her very best rigorous, incisive, empathetic, and witty. . . . Her sharp intelligence, throughout, makes this book compelling, unforgettable, and deeply necessary." <br> <b>Roxane Gay, author of <i>Difficult Women</i> and <i>Bad Feminist</i></b><br><br>"<i>Lower Ed</i> is brilliant. It is nuanced, carefully argued, and engagingly written. It is a powerful, chilling tale of what happens when profit-driven privatization of a public good latches on to systemic inequality and individual aspirations."<br> <b>Carol Anderson, author of <i>White Rage</i> and professor of African American studies at Emory University</b><br><br>"This book is a must-read for anyone interested in the market forces currently transforming higher education. It is an eye-opening portrait of this burgeoning educational sector and the ways in which its rapid expansion is linked to skyrocketing inequality and growing labor precarity in the twenty-first-century United States."<br> <b>Ruth Milkman, past president of the American Sociological Association</b><br><br>"In a sea of simplistic and often bombastic critiques of American higher education, Tressie McMillan Cottom&#x2019;s trenchant analysis of Lower Ed stands out. As the Trump administration moves to make life ever easier for the nation&#x2019;s for-profit colleges, this book offers the most powerful form of resistance detailed storytelling of the causes and consequences of this big-money industry. Anyone frustrated with high college prices, student debt, or the diminishing sense of hope surrounding so many communities needs to read this book."<br> <b>Sara Goldrick-Rab, author of <i>Paying the Price</i> and professor of higher education policy at Temple University</b><br><br>"With passion, eloquence, and data too, McMillan Cottom charts the harm we are doing to our youth, to higher education, and to democracy itself."<br> <b>Cathy N. Davidson, author of <i>Now You See It</i> and founding director of the Futures Initiative at the City University of New York</b><br><br>"[A] profound examination of the role of for-profit colleges in the emerging, new&#x2019; American economic landscape.

Darity Jr., professor of economics, public policy, and African American studies at Duke University</b><br></p><h2>Report from Iron Mountain</h2><p>Upon its first appearance in 1967, this best-selling &#34;secret government report&#34; sparked immediate debate among journalists and scholars with its disturbingly convincing claim: a condition of &#34;permanent peace&#34; at the end of the Cold War would threaten our nation&#39;s economic and social stability. Although finally identified as an antimilitarist hoax by writer/editor Leonard Lewin, who conceived and launched the book with a consortium of peace movement intellectuals including future Nation editors Victor Navasky and Richard Lingeman, novelist E. L. Doctorow, and economist John Kenneth Galbraith, Iron Mountain would eventually take on a life of its own. Long out of print, the Report suddenly reappeared in &#34;bootleg&#34; editions more than twenty years after the original publication. In a manner never foreseen by the book&#39;s creators, it was now being read as a &#34;bible&#34; by the militias of the radical right - a bizarre reversal that returns this haunting satire to the spotlight and raises uncomfortable questions about the changing nature of today&#39;s political culture.</p><p>From 1963 to 1966 the U.S. government assembled a team of prominent thinkers from all walks of life to determine what would happen if "peace broke out." The group, surprisingly but with unassailable logic, determined that war was necessary and desirable and that the government should do all it could to maintain the status quo. If peace became inevitable, the report suggested everything from creating an outer-space menace to setting up some new, socially acceptable form of slavery. The report was leaked in 1967 by a conference member harboring a guilty conscience, and it scandalized Washington.<p>Not.</p><p>The ultimate compliment for any form of political satire is to be taken seriously by the people it is skewering. On that scale <i>Report from Iron Mountain</i>, which has been a lightning rod for both Right and Left since its appearance, could hardly be more successful. The hoax, written in perfect think-tankese, captures the mix of Olympian detachment and awesome cynicism that has flowed out of Washington for much of the American Century. Lewin's book (and he really did write it) exposes the mindset that we can thank for Vietnam and so much else.</p><p><i>Report from Iron Mountain</i> was bolstered, if not trumped, by reality--the Pentagon Papers and the Pax Americana, a Defense Department plan to take over Latin America, emerged soon after. But the book's enduring popularity, particularly among those who never got the joke (apparently Lewin had to sue to get right-wing groups convinced of the book's authenticity to stop printing and selling copies) suggests that the governmental worldview that <i>Report from Iron Mountain</i> lampoons--as well as the paranoia that that immorality unleashes in the citizenry--is very much with us. <i>--Michael Gerber</i></p>When this was first published in 1967, Kirkus's reviewer wrote, ``If it is a fraud, it is a clever one . . . if not, it is a chilling case for the necessity of war as policymakers see it . . . and will provide magnificent fodder for radicals et al.'' Well, this controversial volume did turn out to be a fraud (Lewin's fellow hoaxster Victor Navasky, in his introduction, prefers to call it a satire), and it did provide fodder for radicals--not radicals of the left, as expected, but radicals of the right. This supposedly censored government report, to the effect that the US economy is geared to war and thus peace would be disastrous, seems to feed the loony paranoia that infects the Liberty Lobby, the Michigan Militia, and their cohorts. So why is the Free Press reissuing it? Is it to keep the right-wingers from continuing their unlicensed reproduction of the text and earn royalties for those who deserve them? Is it an indulgent remembrance of youthful journalistic escapades past? (Navasky makes it clear he hasn't lost his puerile glee in putting one over on the New York Times). It's hard to know who will have the last laugh with this one. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

And there is nothing more frightening than watching a child, a loved one, suffer when doctors cannot find out why. In this book you will learn about a million-dollar mansion that was nearly destroyed; a nurse who lost her health and mental function before using the simple discovery presented in this book; a condo in a resort area that was condemned and then rehabilitated; and about a child that was brought to death s doorstep but is now living proof of the power of this discovery. All of these stories have one thing in common -- Mold. Thanks to the information presented in this book, these stories have happy endings. You can enjoy the same results. Learn how to easily overcome the ravages of mold in as little as 24 hours using this new, effective, non-toxic solution to toxic mold that is safe for adults, children, and pets.

Then I found out about Dr. Close s research and decided to try the ten-step protocol in this book. The before-and-after test results were nothing short of astonishing, and they saved me a lot of money.

In this book Dr. Greenspan, the internationally admired child psychiatrist, identifies the six key experiences that enable children to reach their full potential. In <i>Building Healthy Minds</i>, he draws upon discoveries made in his research and practice as he describes the many ways in which games, fantasy play, and conversations with and without words encourage this development. No one has looked so deeply into the very earliest stages of human development, and no other book makes such vital and effective information available to every parent.</p><p><b>Stanley I.

When a young scholar translated the Bible into English he risked his life to smuggle it into the country. When a young man turned down the challenge to fight for his country it meant there was one less soldier for America but one more to make sure that the people of Guatemala received Bibles. Then in 1982 a young woman peers intently towards the sky... an aeroplane is due with some precious cargo. This plane has boxes and to find out their contents go to chapter one!

Your heating fuel is nearly gone, and so is your food. How do you survive? </p><p> Five fourteen&#x2013;year&#x2013;olds face this desperate situation on a deadly journey in Antarctica. It is 2083. They are contes&#x2013;tants on a reality TV show, Antarctic Survivor, which is set up to re&#x2013;create Robert F. Scott's 1912 doomed attempt to be the first to reach the South Pole. </p><p> But in 2083 reality TV is not just an act. Contestants literally relive &#x2013; or die during &#x2013; the simulations of events. Robert Scott and his team were experienced explorers and scientists, but their attempt to reach the Pole proved fatal. What chance does the Antarctic Survivor team have? </p><p> This action&#x2013;packed, riveting adventure &#x2013; full of fascinating direct quotes from Scott's journals and other accounts of the expedition &#x2013; is both a heart&#x2013;wrenching drama from the past and a disquieting glimpse into the future.</p><p> Ages 12+</p></p><p><p><strong>Andrea White</strong> was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, but has spent most of her life in Houston, Texas. She received both undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Texas. She has had several short stories published; this is her first book.</p><p>Besides writing, Ms. White is a community volunteer and education activist. She is married to Bill White, formerly an energy official in the Clinton administration and now the mayor of Houston. The Whites have three children: Will, Elena, and Stephen. They love to hike and camp, and although they've had some hair-raising adventures, says Ms. White, all were tame compared to what happens in <strong>Surviving Antarctica</strong>.</p>Grade 6-10-In 2083, all education in the United States is conducted through television. Shows re-creating historical events like the Battle of the Alamo are used to teach history, and also to give losers in the educational dice roll a chance to earn fame and money. The Secretary of Entertainment, worried about falling ratings, has come up with a splendid idea-re-create Robert F. Scott's 1912 expedition to the South Pole, using 14-year-old kids, most of whom have never even experienced snow. And make sure they are completely isolated by implanting tiny digital cameras directly into their corneas, thus avoiding the need for pesky camera crews who might interfere with the drama. The five participants are the usual band of misfits, including Grace, an I�upiat Eskimo transplanted to Arizona after Alaska is turned into a nuclear waste dump, and Billy, who desperately wants to be voted MVP, but hides snack food from his starving companions. There's also Polly, who has an amazing memory and a surprising capacity for leadership; Robert, great with engines and sheer determination; and Andrew, searching for his special talent and finding unexpected depths of courage. Back in the television studio, a few brave employees surreptitiously help the kids and try to figure out a way to stop the madness. Brisk action, interesting characters, and intriguing (sometimes gruesome) details make this a compelling story, while television's pervasive presence in our lives and the undeniable popularity of the "reality" format give a rather frightening timeliness and believability to the tale.<i>-Mara Alpert, Los Angeles Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It also makes a great gift for your loved ones whether or not they struggle because (success principles aside), this story grips, entertains and inspires.I&#x2019;ve read countless books on success and attended nearly a hundred success-related seminars over a ten year period, but naturally became discouraged since my husband and I experienced little change in our financial picture. Weary of spending money we didn&#x2019;t have on personal growth and learning, and having decided to simply resign myself to the misery of financial bondage, I agreed to attend just one more event.<br> Gratefully, something finally clicked and after a few months of applying this knowledge, our financial picture took a dramatic turn for the better and has never been the same. Why didn&#x2019;t we &#x2018;get it&#x2019; before? Why did all that we need <i>finally</i> begin to come our way? <p>To answer that question, I wasn&#x2019;t <i>about</i> to write yet another &#x2018;how-to&#x2019; book, for I knew there were already thousands of books trying to teach the very same thing in the same way. Mine had to be <i>different</i>, if it was going to help a person <b>experience</b> the same shift in mentality that we had to experience before the remarkable results finally followed.<br> I believe this story will empower businesspeople and young mothers alike...inspire corporate leadership as well as teenagers...motivate seniors to view the rest of their life with new enthusiasm...and help coaches, speakers, and teachers lift their audiences to new heights. It will breathe life into the discouraged and down-trodden. It will instill within the depressed soul new hope.<br> I&#x2019;m just a mom who has seen it not only work for all the big-name leaders out there, but it also works for average every-day kind of people like me as well. So, for my unique perspective on success principles, read "The Jackrabbit Factor: Why You Can."</p></p><h2>Autobiography of a Yogi</h2><p>A reprint of the Philosophical Library 1946 First Edition.</p><p>Autobiography of a Yogi is not an ordinary book. It is a spiritual treasure. To read its message of hope to all truthseekers, is to begin a great adventure. This is a verbatim reprinting of the original, 1946 edition of "Autobiography of a Yogi". Although subsequent printings, reflecting revisions made after the author's death in 1952, have sold over a million copies and have been translated into more than 19 languages, the few thousand of the original have long since disappeared into the hands of collectors. Now, with this reprint, the 1946 edition is again available, with all its inherent power, just as the great master of yoga first presented it. <p>Editions past the third have been prepared since the author's passing in 1952. In 1953, Self-Realization Fellowship, acquired the rights to "Autobiography of a Yogi" from Philosophical Library; it has been the publisher of all subsequent editions, until this original reprint put out by Crystal Clarity, Publishers.

Evans-Wentz, M.A., D.Litt., D.Sc. <p>Jesus College, Oxford; Author of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa, Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines, etc. </p><p>The value of Yogananda's Autobiography is greatly enhanced by the fact that it is one of the few books in English about the wise men of India which has been written, not by a journalist or foreigner, but by one of their own race and training--in short, a book about yogis by a yogi. As an eyewitness recountal of the extraordinary lives and powers of modern Hindu saints, the book has importance both timely and timeless. To its illustrious author, whom I have had the pleasure of knowing both in India and America, may every reader render due appreciation and gratitude. His unusual life-document is certainly one of the most revealing of the depths of the Hindu mind and heart, and of the spiritual wealth of India, ever to be published in the West. </p><p>It has been my privilege to have met one of the sages whose life-history is herein narrated-Sri Yukteswar Giri. A likeness of the venerable saint appeared as part of the frontispiece of my Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines*(1). It was at Puri, in Orissa, on the Bay of Bengal, that I encountered Sri Yukteswar. He was then the head of a quiet ashrama near the seashore there, and was chiefly occupied in the spiritual training of a group of youthful disciples. He expressed keen interest in the welfare of the people of the United States and of all the Americas, and of England, too, and questioned me concerning the distant activities, particularly those in California, of his chief disciple, Paramhansa Yogananda, whom he dearly loved, and whom he had sent, in 1920, as his emissary to the West. </p><p>Sri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence, and worthy of the veneration which his followers spontaneously accorded to him. Every person who knew him, whether of his own community or not, held him in the highest esteem. I vividly recall his tall, straight, ascetic figure, garbed in the saffron-colored garb of one who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at the entrance of the hermitage to give me welcome. His hair was long and somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His body was muscularly firm, but slender and well-formed, and his step energetic. He had chosen as his place of earthly abode the holy city of Puri, whither multitudes of pious Hindus, representative of every province of India, come daily on pilgrimage to the famed Temple of Jagannath, "Lord of the World." It was at Puri that Sri Yukteswar closed his mortal eyes, in 1936, to the scenes of this transitory state of being and passed on, knowing that his incarnation had been carried to a triumphant completion. </p><p>I am glad, indeed, to be able to record this testimony to the high character and holiness of Sri Yukteswar. Content to remain afar from the multitude, he gave himself unreservedly and in tranquillity to that ideal life which Paramhansa Yogananda, his disciple, has now described for the ages W. Y.

Until recently, however, we have had few clues to unlock the secrets of the brain. Now, research from the neurosciences has greatly improved our understanding of the learning process, and we have a much more solid foundation on which to base educational decisions.<br><br>In this completely revised and updated second edition, Patricia Wolfe clarifies how we can effectively match teaching practice with brain functioning. Encompassing the most recent and relevant research and knowledge, this edition also includes three entirely new chapters that examine brain development from birth through adolescence and identify the impact of exercise, sleep, nutrition, and technology on the brain. <br><br>Brain Matters begins with a mini-textbook on brain anatomy and physiology, bringing the biology of the brain into context with teaching and learning. Wolfe describes how the brain encodes, manipulates, and stores information, and she proposes implications that recent research has for practice why meaning is essential for attention, how emotion can enhance or impede learning, and how different types of rehearsal are necessary for different types of learning.<br><br>Finally, Wolfe introduces and examines practical classroom applications and brain-compatible teaching strategies that take advantage of simulations, projects, problem-based learning, graphic organizers, music, active engagement, and mnemonics. These strategies are accompanied by actual classroom scenarios spanning the content areas and grade levels from lower elementary to high school that help teachers connect theory with practice.</p><p></p><h2>Pathworking the Tarot: Spiritual Guidance &amp; Practical Advice from the Cards</h2><p><p><strong>Enhance Your Tarot Skills and Expand Your Spirituality by Delving Deeper into Each Card's Story</strong></p> <p>Just as using a tarot deck is a journey through a story, so is pathworking a journey through an inner landscape to find higher awareness and spiritual growth.

It is no wonder, then, that filmmakers and photographers constantly return to the swimming pool as a subject and setting.</p><p>Reflections of water and light are captured in countless unique ways in the more than 200 compelling images of pools and swimmers that comprise this catalog. <i>The Swimming Pool in Photography</i> includes works by Henri Cartier-Bresson, Gigi Cifali, Stuart Franklin, Harry Gruyaert, Emma Hartvig, Jacques Henri Lartigue, Joel Meyerowitz, Martin Parr, Paolo Pelligrin, Mack Sennett, Alec Soth, Larry Sultan, Alex Webb and many others.</p></p><p>Old ones, new ones, drained ones, blue ones.

He made anyone and everyone comfortable to fly their unique freak flag.</p><p>Growing up as a child of the 1980s, I caught the second and third waves of Bowie&#x2019;s work. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s Dance,&#x201d; &#x201c;China Girl,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Under Pressure&#x201d; were the first hits that made me take notice: &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s sway / While color lights up your face / Let&#x2019;s sway / Sway through the crowd to an empty space.&#x201d; Bowie swayed me. He convinced me because he was one of a kind. He persuaded me with his stories. And from there I was off with all-night sojourns into the entire Bowie canon. His albums mixed an astonishing array of genres, from art rock to glam rock to post-punk, electronica, hard rock, jazz, new wave, and unfortunately even disco. There was nothing he couldn&#x2019;t do.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not alone in my obsession. After all, he is one of the bestselling recording artists of all time. Without him there is no Cure, U2, Lou Reed, Joy Division, LCD Soundsystem, or even Lady Gaga. Rolling Stone magazine recently called him &#x201c;the greatest rock star who ever fell to this or any other world.&#x201d;</p><p>But with Bowie, the main attraction was never just &#x201c;Changes&#x201d; or &#x201c;Ashes to Ashes&#x201d;; it was Bowie&#x2014;or Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane, the Thin White Duke, or one of his endless supply of alter egos. Before he was Bowie, David Robert Jones was a struggling musician moving from band to band and churning out a string of singles nobody bought. Even after he changed his name to David Bowie, his first solo album went nowhere&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s easy to see why. In those years, Bowie was still trying to fit into existing categories of what he thought people wanted him to be. Whether he was playing blues covers or folk, it all sounded like something people had already heard. It was all too familiar.</p><p>And guess what? Nobody wanted anything to do with that David Bowie.</p><p>But by 1969, when he dropped &#x201c;Space Oddity&#x201d; days before the launch of NASA&#x2019;s Apollo 11, he was on his way to becoming an international rock god that would change the shape of popular culture forever. In the decade that followed, he went on a creative tear unequaled in the history of rock. From the albums <i>The Man Who Sold the World, Hunky Dory,</i> and <i>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust </i>and the <i>Spiders from Mars </i>on through to <i>Young Americans, Heroes, </i>and the posthumous release of the haunting masterpiece <i>Blackstar</i>, Bowie was constantly reinventing himself, incorporating new ideas, pushing boundaries, and challenging assumptions every chance he got&#x2014;even from beyond the grave.</p><p>The timing of this renaissance was no accident. Bowie spent the two years between his first failed solo album and the release of &#x201c;Space Oddity&#x201d; discovering new influences and exploring new ways of making art. He lived at a Buddhist monastery, studied dance, drama, and mime, and helped create an experimental arts lab. He was finding ways to be his true self and express it better. He went deep into himself so that he could understand what he wanted to say and convince all of us to pay attention.</p><p>Most of all, he found his own vision and learned to always trust it.</p><p>What made him irresistible as an artist is that he wasn&#x2019;t trying to be the next Jagger or Dylan. He was becoming the first and only David Bowie, a man to whom old categories just didn&#x2019;t apply. He wasn&#x2019;t blues or pop, psychedelic or soul, man or woman, gay or straight. He didn&#x2019;t have a single identity. What united everything he did was that it came from David Bowie being an original. And that was enough.</p><p>Growing up outside of Washington, D.C., in conservative Fairfax County, Virginia, I would pore over Bowie&#x2019;s every album, lyric, and persona. I didn&#x2019;t always know what I was feeling when I listened to a Bowie track, but I knew I felt something soulful. And it was way more interesting than the band Wham!</p><p>At the time I discovered Bowie, I was already the semi&#x2013;black sheep of my family. My parents and a lot of my relatives are teachers and academics. My interests were incomprehensible to them. I was not a bookworm; I was a shameless television addict obsessed with Knight Rider and The Greatest American Hero. I also loved watching the thirty-second stories sprinkled between the TV shows. I still think about ads like &#x201c;Oh yeah!&#x201d; from the Kool-Aid Man, &#x201c;How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?&#x201d; or &#x201c;Leggo my Eggo&#x201d;&#x2014;a tagline that my sister and I repeated countless times at the breakfast table. Even today I find myself saying &#x201c;Time to make the donuts&#x201d;&#x2014;from the Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts ads of my childhood&#x2014;when I head off to work. I would break down every component of these old ads, from the music to the acting to the direction, analyzing what made them work. Did that ad persuade me to buy the thing they were hawking? This was definitely not normal behavior for a twelve-year-old, certainly not in my family of intellectuals and educators.</p><p>It took David Bowie to show me that weirdness isn&#x2019;t something to fight against&#x2014;it&#x2019;s something to wrap your arms around. Bowie gave me license to be my own strange and unique self.</p><p>Ironically, Bowie&#x2019;s first and only office job was as an artist at Nevin D. Hirst Advertising in London. He washed out of that gig pretty quickly. But even later on, he maintained a close relationship with the advertising world, appearing in TV spots for everything from Pepsi to Louis Vuitton.</p><p>It may sound counterintuitive that I learned the importance of authenticity from David Bowie&#x2014;the master of self-creation, the man of endless identities&#x2014;but it makes sense. Yes, he was a mess of contradictions and radically different personalities, but it was all original and true to Bowie every single time. You may not have understood what he was up to, but you knew he was showing you a unique side of himself and that he didn&#x2019;t care what anyone else thought. You felt it in your bones.</p><p>And that quality of being authentically yourself is at the heart of all persuasion.</p><p>Character Is King</p><p>Persuasion is about personal character, not facts or argument. The most powerful modes of persuasion don&#x2019;t have much to do with evidence, argument, or logic. In fact, often what persuades people isn&#x2019;t the substance of what&#x2019;s being said but the source--in other words, the person saying it. Aristotle knew this more than two millennia ago. As he put it, &#x201c;We believe good men more fully and more readily than others . . . [A speaker&#x2019;s] character may almost be called the most effective means of persuasion he possesses.&#x201d;</p><p>This makes sense. On most issues, we just don&#x2019;t have the knowledge, time, or expertise to figure out on our own which side to take. I trust my doctor when he tells me I need to take vitamin D supplements or to stay off my sprained ankle for a week. It isn&#x2019;t the science that convinces me--I didn&#x2019;t go to medical school and I have no idea why we need so much damn vitamin D, but my doctor went to medical school and studied to know her craft, and the good ones project the conviction and character to make us listen.</p><p>When a politician tries to persuade you about tax reform or national security or immigration, most of the time you don&#x2019;t have enough information to decide based on the facts alone. You&#x2019;re deciding based on whether or not this person seems well intentioned, trustworthy, confident, and sincere. You&#x2019;re deciding based on the individual&#x2019;s perceived character.</p><p>What I mean by character&#x2014;or, more important, what Aristotle meant&#x2014;isn&#x2019;t just the list of ethical rules you try to follow or the personal beliefs you hold. Your character is also made up of the habits and dispositions that you display without thinking. When a brave person sees a burning school, they don&#x2019;t hesitate to run into the building to help the kids inside. When an honest person finds a lost wallet, they do their best to return it to its owner and don&#x2019;t consider for a second taking the cash inside. A sincere person tells the truth reflexively, not after weighing the pros and cons of being truthful.</p><p>So the character traits that make you persuasive also need to flow from your core. People need to know that they&#x2019;re getting a glimpse of the real you--a peek at something that you don&#x2019;t even know that you&#x2019;re showing them.</p></p><h2>The Outlaws (Presidential Agent, Book 6)</h2><p><b>The former Presidential Agent&#x2019;s Office of Organizational Analysis has been disbanded.

The town of Al-Ubayyid was sometimes known as El Obeid. In this remote corner of the world, what a village or an airport&#x2014;or just about anything else&#x2014;was called depended on who was talking.</p><p>The men were all armed with Kalashnikov rifles, and all bearded, and all were dressed in the long pastel-colored robes known as <i>jalabiya,</i> and wearing both <i>tagia</i> skullcaps and a length of cloth, called an <i>imma</i>, covering their heads.</p><p>The beds of the trucks each held one or two armed men. It was impossible to tell&#x2014;even guess&#x2014;what the cargo might be, as it was covered with a tarpaulin.</p><p>The convoy looked, in other words, very much like any other convoy passing through&#x2014;or originating in&#x2014;Al-Ubayyid on any given day. By whatever name, the town had been a transportation hub for nearly two centuries. First, there had been camel caravans. Then a rail line. Then roads&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a nine-hour, five-hundred-kilometer trip from Khartoum&#x2014;and finally, six kilometers south of town, the airport with a runway nearly a thousand meters long.</p><p>As it approached the airport, the convoy slowed and the headlights were turned off. It moved near to the end of the chainlink fence surrounding the airport and stopped, remaining on the road.</p><p>A dozen men&#x2014;everyone but the drivers&#x2014;quickly got out of the vehicles.</p><p>The man who had been in the front seat of the Land Rover went to the floodlight&#x2014;not much of a floodlight, just a single fluorescent tube&#x2014;on a pole at the end of the fencing and quickly shot it out with a burst from a .22 caliber submachine gun. The weapon was &#x201c;suppressed,&#x201d; which meant that perhaps eighty percent of the noise a .22-long rifle cartridge would normally make was silenced.</p><p>He then quickly joined the others, who were in the process of quickly removing the immas and skullcaps from their heads and finally their long jalabiya robes. The discarded garments were then tossed into the Land Rover.</p><p>Under the jalabiya robes they had been wearing black form-fitting garments, something like underwear except these had attached hoods which, when they had been pulled in place, covered the head and most of the face.</p><p>Night-vision goggles and radio headsets were quickly put in place.</p><p>Next, they took from the Land Rover and the pickups black nylon versions of what was known in the U.S. and many other armies as &#x201c;web equipment&#x201d; and strapped it in place on their bodies.</p><p>The man with the .22 caliber submachine gun&#x2014;the team leader&#x2014;was joined by two other men equipped with special weapons. One was armed with a high-powered, suppressed sniper&#x2019;s rifle that was equipped with both night vision and laser sights. The other had a suppressed Uzi 9mm submachine gun.</p><p>The laws of physics are such that no high-powered weapon can ever be really suppressed, much less silenced. The best that could be said for the suppressed sniper&#x2019;s rifle was that when fired, it didn&#x2019;t make very much noise. The best that could be said for the Uzi was that when fired, it sounded like a suppressed Uzi submachine gun, which meant that it wasn&#x2019;t quite as noisy as an unsuppressed Uzi.</p><p>The sights on the sniper&#x2019;s rifle, which was a highly modified version of the Russian Dragunov SVD-S caliber 7.62 x 54R sniper&#x2019;s rifle, were state-of-the-art. When looking through the night-vision scope&#x2014;which had replaced the standard glass optical scope&#x2014;the marksman was able to see on the darkest of nights just about anything he needed to.</p><p>And by sliding a switch near the trigger, a small computer was turned on. A laser beam was activated. The computer determined how distant was the object on which sat the little red spot, and sent that message to the crosshairs on the sight. The result was that the shooter could be about ninety percent sure that&#x2014;presuming he did everything else required of a marksman since the rifle was invented, such as having a good sight picture, firing from a stable position, taking a breath and letting half of it out before ever so carefully <i>squeezing</i> the trigger&#x2014;the 147-grain bullet would strike his target within an inch or so of where the little red dot pinpointed.</p><p>The team leader made a somewhat imperious gesture, which caused another man&#x2014;who had been standing by awaiting the order&#x2014;to apply an enormous set of bolt cutters to the chainlink fence.</p><p>Within a minute, he had cut a gate in the fencing through which everyone could&#x2014;and quickly did&#x2014;easily pass.</p><p>The runway was about fifty meters wide. An inspection, which the team leader considered the most dangerous activity of this part of the operation, was required. A good leader, he had assumed this responsibility himself; he walked quickly in a crouch down the dotted line marking the center of the runway toward the small terminal building.</p><p>The man with the suppressed Uzi walked down the runway halfway between the dotted line and the left side, and the man with the sniper&#x2019;s rifle did the same thing on the right.</p><p>All the others made their way toward the terminal off the runway, about half on one side and half on the other. Most of them were now armed with the Mini Uzi, which is smaller than the Uzi and much larger than the Micro Uzi. The Kalashnikovs, as much a part of their try-to-pass-as-the-locals disguises as anything else, had joined the jalabiya robes and skullcaps in the Land Rover.</p><p>They had gone about halfway down the runway when a dog&#x2014;a large dog, from the sound of him&#x2014;began to bark. Or maybe it was the sound of <i>two</i> large dogs.</p><p>Everyone dropped flat.</p><p>The man with the Dragunov assumed the firing position, turned on the night sights, and peered down the runway.</p><p>He took his hand off the fore end and raised it with two fingers extended.</p><p>The team leader nodded.</p><p>The two shots didn&#x2019;t make very much noise, and there was no more barking.</p><p>The team leader considered his options.</p><p>It was possible that the shots had been heard, and equally possible that someone had come out of the terminal to see why the dogs were barking on the runway, or that they had come out&#x2014;or were about to&#x2014;to see why the barking dogs had stopped barking.</p><p>That meant the sooner they got to the terminal, the better.</p><p>But the problem of having to inspect the runway remained&#x2014;that was the priority.</p><p>The team leader activated his microphone.</p><p>He spoke in Hungarian: &#x201c;Trucks, lights out&#x2014;repeat, lights out&#x2014;to one hundred meters of the terminal. Hold for orders.&#x201d;</p><p>There was no need to give orders to the others; they would follow his example.</p><p>He got to his feet and resumed his inspection, this time at a fast trot, still crouched over.</p><p>The sniper and the man with the suppressed Uzi followed his example. The men off the runway, after a moment, followed their example.</p><p>They came to the dogs, lying in pools of blood where the animals had fallen, about a hundred meters from the terminal building.</p><p>The team leader could now see the flicker of fluorescent lights in the terminal bui...</p></p><h2>Modernity and the Holocaust</h2><p>A new afterword to this edition, "The Duty to Remember&#x2015;But What?" tackles difficult issues of guilt and innocence on the individual and societal levels. Zygmunt Bauman explores the silences found in debates about the Holocaust, and asks what the historical facts of the Holocaust tell us about the hidden capacities of present-day life. He finds great danger in such phenomena as the seductiveness of martyrdom; going to extremes in the name of safety; the insidious effects of tragic memory; and efficient, "scientific" implementation of the death penalty. Bauman writes, "Once the problem of the guilt of the Holocaust perpetrators has been by and large settled . . . the one big remaining question is the innocence of all the rest&#x2015;not the least the innocence of ourselves."Among the conditions that made the mass extermination of the Holocaust possible, according to Bauman, the most decisive factor was modernity itself. Bauman's provocative interpretation counters the tendency to reduce the Holocaust to an episode in Jewish history, or to one that cannot be repeated in the West precisely because of the progressive triumph of modern civilization. He demonstrates, rather, that we must understand the events of the Holocaust as deeply rooted in the very nature of modern society and in the central categories of modern social thought.</p><p>Sociology is concerned with modern society, but has never come to terms with one of the most distinctive and horrific aspects of modernity - the Holocaust. <p>The book examines what sociology can teach us about the Holocaust, but more particularly concentrates upon the lessons which the Holocaust has for sociology.

Now they turn their hands to <i>A is for Abigail: An Almanac of Amazing American Women</i> and bring the great women of American history to life. Filled to the brim with words and pictures that celebrate the remarkable (although often unmarked) achievements of American women, this is a book to relish and to read again and again. <br> Mothers, daughters, schoolchildren, generations of families -- everyone -- will take Abigail Adams's words to heart and "remember the ladies" once they read the stories of these astonishing, astounding, <i>amazing</i> American women.</p><p>Soldiers, scientists, performers, writers, entrepreneurs, politicians, quilt makers, pilots... as author Lynne Cheney writes, "America&#x2019;s amazing women have much to teach our children--and much inspiration to offer us, as well." Coming on the heels of <i>America: A Patriotic Primer</i> (Cheney&#x2019;s previous collaboration with illustrator Robin Preiss Glasser), <i>A Is for Abigail</i> celebrates the achievements of women in American history, with a special emphasis on the individuals who helped win equal rights for women. As with <i>America</i>, Cheney uses an alphabet book format to introduce hundreds of remarkable real women: "O is for SANDRA DAY O&#x2019;CONNOR and others who were first." In addition to the first woman Supreme Court Justice, the "O" page includes Wilma Mankiller, first woman chief of the Cherokee Nation; Jeannette Rankin, first female member of Congress; and Nellie Tayloe Ross, first woman governor. Glasser&#x2019;s playful illustrations are lively and busy, inviting readers to explore Abigail Adams's farm or the crowded city block that houses "V is for VARIETY," with its DNA lab, dance studio, dentist office, and "PERSONS at WORK" sign. Snippets of information about each featured woman give a taste; ideally, readers will seek more in-depth biographies about the historical figures who pique their interests.

Her training began in Tokyo when she became a member of the Ichinawa-kai where she studied rope intensively under Shishi-waka and Kurage Umitsuki for a year and a half. This required eight hours of instruction and practice each day which drew on the long historical traditions of rope bondage in Japan. Following this, she took advanced classes as a student of Hajime Kinoko for a year.Performances given by Miumi-U are lively and creative with touches of humour interlaced with the telling of a story using costumes, ropes, burning tapers other items; and like stories, there is usually a twist in the tale at the end.</p><h2>What the Bleep Do We Know!?&#x2122;: Discovering the Endless Possibilities for Altering Your Everyday Reality</h2><p><i>"Guides readers on a course from the scientific to the spiritual; from the universal to the truly personal."</i><br> <b>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly</b><br> <br>What the Bleep Do We Know!? is a book of amazing science, and now the international bestselling book is available in paperback.

It brings in a breath of fresh air. It makes life more joyful. The real trick to life is not to be in the know, but to be in the mystery. </p> <p>Fred Alan Wolf </p> <p>What IS a Great Question? </p> <p>Why should we bother? </p> <p>What makes it Great? </p> <p>Let's say a spaceship lands next to you on the coffee table (does size matter?) and inside is The Universal Book of Everything. And you get to ask one question. What is that question? </p> <p>This may seem a little silly, but it's worth the effort. Take a minute and think. What would that question be? It can be anything. Go ahead and write it down in a journal. </p> <p>Now let's say The Book is feeling a little underutilized these days, and you get a bonus question. Think of something that you are just plain curious about. It can be wondering if Elvis is still alive, or where you left your car keys. Something that simply tickles your fancy. Write that down, too. </p> <p>And by now The Book is feeling a little depleted, and it got to be The Universal Book of Everything by asking questions of everyone and getting real answers. So, the question for you (the answer to which will be added in The Book) is: </p> <p>What is the One Thing you know for sure? </p> <p>Great Questions&#x2015;The Can Opener </p> <p>of Consciousness </p> <p>Aside from the few like Fred Alan Wolf (who we quoted on the opening page), when do we ever get encouraged to ask questions? And yet, most of those grand discoveries and revelations that our society cherishes came from asking questions. Those things, those answers, that we study in school came from questions. Questions are the precursor, or first cause, in every branch of human knowledge. The Indian sage Ramana Maharshi told his students the path to Enlightenment was summed up in: 'Who am I?' The physicist Niels Bohr asked, 'How can an electron move from A to B, and never go in between?' </p> <p>These questions open us up to what we previously didn't know. And they're really the only way to get there&#x2015;to the other side of the unknown. </p> <p>Why ask a Great Question? Asking a Great Question is an invitation to an adventure, a journey of discovery. It's thrilling to set out on a new adventure; there's the bliss of freedom, the freedom to explore new territory. </p> <p>So why don't we ask these questions? Because asking questions opens the door to chaos, to the unknown and unpredictable. The minute you ask a question you truly don't know the answer to, you open yourself up to a field of all possibilities. Are you willing to receive an answer you may not like or agree with? What if it makes you uncomfortable, or carries you outside the zone of safety and security you've built for yourself? What if the answer isn't what you want to hear!? </p> <p>It doesn't take muscles; it takes bravery to ask a question. </p> <p>Now let's consider what makes a question Great. A Great Question doesn't have to come from a philosophy book, or be about Life's Big Issues. A Great Question for you might be, 'What would happen if I decided to go back to college and get a degree in a new field?' or 'Should I listen to that voice that keeps telling me to go to California or China?' or 'Is it possible to discover what is inside a neutrino?' Asking any of these questions and thousands of others could change the direction of your life. That's what a Great Question is: one that can change the direction of your life. </p> <p>So, once again, why don't we ask them? Most people would rather stay in the safety of the known than go looking for trouble. Even if they crash right into a question, more than likely they will run away from it, stick their head in the sand or quickly get busy doing something else. </p> <p>For most of us, it takes a serious crisis to bring on the Great Questions: a life-threatening illness, the death of someone close, failure of a business or a marriage, a repeated, even addictive behavior pattern you just can't seem to shake, or loneliness that seems unendurable for one more day. At times like those, Great Questions come boiling up from the depths of our being like hot lava. These questions are not intellectual exercises, but cries of the soul. 'Why me? Why him? What have I done wrong? After this, is life truly worth living? How could God allow this to happen?' </p> <p>If we could muster up the same kind of passion to ask ourselves a Great Question about our lives now, when there is no immediate crisis, who knows what could happen? </p> <p>As Dr. Wolf said, asking a Great Question can open up new ways of being in the world. It can be a catalyst for transformation. Growing. Outgrowing. Moving on. </p> <p><b>The Joy of Questions </b></p> <p>Remember when you were five years old and you kept asking, 'Why?' Your parents may have thought, after a while, that you were doing it simply to drive them crazy, but you really wanted to know! What happened to that five-year-old? </p> <p>Can you remember the five-year-old who was you? Can you feel what it was like? This is important, because when you were five, you loved being in the mystery. You loved wanting to figure things out. You loved the journey. Each day was filled with new discoveries and new questions. </p> <p>So what is the difference between then and now? </p> <p>Good question! </p> <p>The fun and joy of life are in the journey. In our culture, we've been conditioned to look at 'not knowing' as something unacceptable and bad; it's some kind of failure. In order to pass the test, we have to know the answers. But even when it comes to factual knowledge about concrete things, what science doesn't know far exceeds what it does. Many of the greatest scientists have looked into the mystery of the universe and of life on our planet, and have frankly said, 'We know very little. Mostly we have a lot of questions.' This is certainly true of the outstanding thinkers we interviewed. In the words of author Terence McKenna, 'As the bonfires of knowledge grow brighter, the more the darkness is revealed to our startled eyes.' </p> <p>It's even more difficult to come up with a clear-cut answer to 'What is the meaning and purpose of my life?' The answer to Great Questions like this can only emerge from the journey of living. And we can only arrive at it by the road of not knowing&#x2015;or maybe we should say, not-yet-knowing. If we always think we know the answer, how will we grow? What will we ever be open to learn? </p> <p>A university professor visited Zen master Nan-in to inquire about Zen. But instead of listening to the master, the scholar kept going on and on about his own ideas. </p> <p>After listening for some time, Nan-in served tea. He poured his visitor's cup full, and then kept on pouring. The tea flowed over the sides of the cup, filled the saucer, spilled onto the man's pants and onto the floor. </p> <p>'Don't you see that the cup is full?' the professor exploded. 'You can't get any more in!' </p> <p>'Just so,' replied Nan-in calmly. 'And like this cup, you are full of your own ideas and opinions. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?' </p> <p>Emptying the cup means making room for Great Questions. It means being open, reconditioning ourselves so that we can accept, for the time being, not knowing. Out of that a greater knowing will dawn. </p> <p><b>It's OK Not To Know the Answer </b></p> <p>A little while ago my sixteen-year-old niece sent me a long email. The gist of it was, 'Life sucks. I see my dad coming home from work every day totally bummed out. I don't want to get trapped in the rat race, but I don't see any hope of avoiding it. Is this what life is about? What's the point? I might as well just shoot myself and die.' </p> <p>'Christina,' I wrote back, 'you might not think this is a great response, but I'm proud of you. I can't tell you that you are going to solve your dilemma and find The Answer. I know you want answers&#x2015;but sometimes life doesn't provide them right away. But you are asking the right questions, and that is important.' </p> <p>&#x2015;Will </p> <p><b>You're in Distinguished Company </b></p> <p>People have been asking Great Questions for thousands of years. There have always been men and women who gazed at the stars and wondered at the vast mystery of it all, or who looked at the way people around them were living and thought, 'Isn't there more to life than this?' </p> <p>The ancient Greek philosophers pondered and discussed the Great Questions. Some, like Socrates and Plato, asked, 'What is Beauty? What is Goodness? What is Justice? What is the best way to govern a society? What people are fit to be rulers?' </p> <p>Religious teachers, mystics and spiritual masters like Buddha, Lao Tse, Jesus, Muhammad, St. Francis, Meister Eckhardt, Apollonius of Tyana and many more, in all the world's traditions, have asked Great Questions. </p> <p>People with scientific minds have always asked questions. How does it work? What's inside? Are things really the way they seem? Where does the universe come from? Is the Earth the center of the solar system? Are there laws and patterns that underlie what happens in daily life? What's the connection between my body and my mind? </p> <p>For the great scientists of history, these questions elicit a passion to understand that goes way beyond curiosity. They're not just curious&#x2015;they need to know! </p> <p>When Albert Einstein was a boy, he asked himself: 'What happens if I'm riding my bicycle at the speed of light and I switch on my bike light&#x2015;will it come on?' He nearly drove himself crazy asking himself that for ten years, but out of that resolute pursuit came the relativity theory. This is a great example of asking a question and hanging with it for years, in the unknown, until he came up with a completely different view of reality. </p> <p><b>Paradigm Busting </b></p> <p>One of the great things about science is its assumption that what it thinks it knows today will probably be proven wrong tomorrow. The theories of yesterday have served as platforms to climb higher, as Sir Isaac Newton meant when he said, 'If I have been privileged to see farther than others, it's because I stood on the shoulders of giants.' </p> <p>It's only by asking questions, challenging the assumptions and the 'truths' taken for granted at any given time, that science progresses. What if that turned out to be true about our personal lives, our individual growth and progress? </p> <p>Guess what? It is true. When you break free of your assumptions about yourself, you will grow more than you ever thought possible. </p> <p><b>Bring It on Home </b></p> <p>Pondering the Great Questions is a wonderful way to spend 'quality time' with your mind. When was the last time you took your mind on a wild ride of mystery? Tried to get to the other side of Infinity? </p> <p>Asking questions also has enormous practical value. It's the gateway to change. </p> <p>For instance: Ever ask yourself, as Joe Dispenza asks, 'Why do we keep recreating the same reality? Why do we keep having the same relationships? Why do we keep getting the same jobs over and over again? In this infinite sea of potentials that exist around us, how come we keep recreating the same realities?' </p> <p>Or as Einstein put it, one of the definitions of insanity is to do the same things over and over and expect a different result. </p> <p>That's where asking Great Questions comes in. They are Great because they open us up to a greater reality, a greater vista and greater options. And they come in the form of Questions because they come from the other side of the Known. And to get there is to change. </p> <p><b>Ponder These for a While . . . </b></p> <p>A note about 'Ponder These': Some of these questions many of us can answer easily. But the trick is to not just look at the obvious, but to look at the unobvious&#x2015;the subconsciousness. The place we don't look very often, if ever. When you consider the questions here, remember to look all the way inside yourself. Think about things that you may have picked up when you were young. Like fear, for instance: Does a fear of dogs permeate throughout your consciousness in other ways? Take some time. There's no one at the back of the room with a stopwatch! </p> <p>� Remember your first three questions from the beginning of the chapter? What are they now? </p> <p>� A spaceship lands next to you, and inside is The Universal Book of Everything. You get a bonus question, a just-for-fun question. What is it? </p> <p>� And the bonus bonus: Are we back where we started? Or have we moved on? </p> <p>Remind yourself of these questions as you read this book. They are bound to evolve as you evolve. That's the fun part! Keep a journal so you can watch your own evolution and remember. </p> <p>All great things are achieved in a light heart! </p> <p>&#x2015;Ramtha </p> <br><p>�2007.

He attended Keio University where he majored in French. After graduating he held numerous odd jobs, including a stint as a cram school teacher. Also a self-described jock, he holds a first-class yachting license and crossed the U.S., from Key West to Los Angeles, on his motorcycle. The father of two daughters, Suzuki is a respected authority on childrearing and has written numerous works on the subject. He acquired his expertise when he was a struggling writer and househusband. Suzuki also has translated a children&#39;s book into Japanese, The Little Sod Diaries by the crime novelist Simon Brett. In 1990, Suzuki&#39;s first full-length work, Paradise won the Japanese Fantasy Novel Award and launched his career as a fiction writer. Ring, written with a baby on his lap, catapulted him to fame, and the multi-million selling sequels Spiral and Loop cemented his reputation as a world-class talent. Often called the &#34;Stephen King of Japan,&#34; Suzuki has played a crucial role in establishing mainstream credentials for horror novels in his country. He is based in Tokyo but loves to travel, often in the United States.

It's a truth that we of the twenty-first century most urgently need to learn in order to heal the experience of alienation that has become endemic to our age, and these odd and appealing ancient figures, surprisingly, hold keys to this healing. <br><br>The fourth-century Christian hermits of Egypt, Syria, and Palestine understood the truth of Christian community profoundly, and their lives demonstrate it vividly&#x2014;even though they often lived in solitude and isolation. The author breaks through our preconceived ideas of the Desert Fathers to reveal them in a new light: as true and worthy role models&#x2014;even for us in our modern lives&#x2014;who have much to teach us about dealing with the anxieties, uncertainties, and sense of isolation that have become hallmarks of modern life. They especially embody valuable insights about community, about how to live together in an intimate and meaningful way. Williams makes these radical figures, who clearly have a special place in his heart, come to life in a new way for everyone. <br><br>The book includes an appendix of selections from the teachings of the Desert Fathers.</p><p>Rowan Williams, the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury, is an acclaimed theologian, writer, and pastor, in addition to being the spiritual leader of the world's 100 million Anglicans.

He has been Canon Theologian of Leicester Cathedral, Bishop of Monmouth in the Church of Wales, and Archbishop of Wales. He is the author of several books, including <i>The Dwelling of Light </i> and <i>A Ray of Darkness. </i>Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury and leader of the Anglican Church, has penned a remarkable little book that makes it all both relevant and accessible. Even if the names of these monks and nuns are foreign to you, their pearls of wisdom are not. This is a great introduction to the early hermits. For those interested in learning more, the book ends with a wonderful chapter on monastic wisdom, with detailed notes and suggestions for further reading.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Plain Dealer</i> (Cleveland) <br><br>"Rowan Williams is a scholar and priest, a mystic and a poet, a contemplative and an advocate for social justice&#x2014;all rare combinations for a church leader.&nbsp; In <i>Where God Happens</i>, he combines his roles by examining the ancient wisdom of the Desert Fathers and interpreting the relevance of their teaching for Christian spirituality today.&nbsp;In the early monastics' search for the experience of God and an alternative style of community, he finds a new and deeper faith for the postmodern world.&nbsp;This compelling work of scholarship and spirituality shows why the Archbishop of Canterbury is truly a breath of fresh air and one of the most important and hopeful church leaders we have today."&#x2014;Jim Wallis, editor of <i>Sojourners</i> magazine, author of <i>God's Politics </i><br>"Rowan Williams calls for a Church renewed in contemplation. In the raucous circus of contemporary culture and religion nothing could be more important.&nbsp; And this book is immensely practical&#x2014;nailing us just where we are&#x2014;teaching us that the spiritual life is 'not only about how prayer is to be experienced but about how humanity is to be understood.' There's a liberating sanity here in the simplicity of the message: 'our life is with our neighbor,' and 'being is communion.' This is required reading for spiritual pilgrims of all traditions."&#x2014;Alan Jones, Dean of Grace Cathedral, San Francisco, author of <i>Soul Making </i> and <i>Reimagining Christianity </i><br>"This book is a marvelous introduction to the first Christian monks, the Desert Fathers, and makes their wisdom available and relevant for the twenty-first century reader; but it does more, since it is written in the same spirit as the texts from the desert, that is, as a clear window that will give direct access to God."&#x2014;Benedicta Ward, translator of <i>Sayings of the Desert Fathers </i> and <i>The Wisdom of the Desert Fathers</i></p><h2>The MindSide Manifesto: The Urgency to Create a Competitive Mindset</h2><p>Life is meant to be lived fully.

Brandeis, Benjamin Cardozo, Felix Frankfurter, Arthur Goldberg, Abe Fortas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, and Elena Kagan. David Dalin discusses the relationship that these Jewish justices have had with the presidents who appointed them, and given the judges&#x2019; Jewish background, investigates the antisemitism some of the justices encountered in their ascent within the legal profession before their appointment, as well as the role that antisemitism played in the attendant political debates and Senate confirmation battles. Other topics and themes include the changing role of Jews within the American legal profession and the views and judicial opinions of each of the justices on freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the death penalty, the right to privacy, gender equality, and the rights of criminal defendants, among other issues.</p><p>DAVID G. DALIN, a historian and rabbi, is the author, coauthor or editor of eleven books, including Religion and State in the American Jewish Experience (coauthored with Jonathan D. Sarna) and The Presidents of the United States and the Jews. His articles and book reviews have appeared in a variety of publications, including American Jewish History, Commentary, Modern Judaism, the Weekly Standard, the American Jewish Year Book, and the Jewish Review of Books.&#x201c;This landmark collective biography of the Jewish men and women who have served on our nation&#x2019;s highest court reminds us that, long before the twenty-first century, conservatives and liberals battled over the limits of free speech, the rule of reason, and even fake news. David Dalin&#x2019;s Jewish Justices of the Supreme Court is that all-too-rare history that serves up lessons from the past that speak to our moment in time.&#x201d; (Pamela S. Nadell, president of the Association for Jewish Studies, and Patrick Clendenen Chair in Women&#x2019;s and Gender History at American University)<br><br>&#x201c;Although Jewish justices have played a central role on the modern Supreme Court, David Dalin&#x2019;s book is the first to offer a comprehensive series of portraits of the entire group, from Louis Brandeis to Elena Kagan. With memorable details and gripping narrative, Dalin provides an invaluable account of the contributions of these remarkable justices, who continue to shape our understanding of the Constitution today.&#x201d; (Jeffrey Rosen, president and CEO, National Constitution Center, and author of Louis D. Brandeis: American Prophet)<br><br>&#x201c;The scholarship behind this work is impressive. The writing is authoritative, and the research and knowledge displayed are extraordinary. . . . this will be the go-to book regarding Jews and the Supreme Court.&#x201d; (Gil Troy, professor of history, McGill University, and author of The Age of Clinton: America in the 1990s)<br><br>&#x201c;David Dalin&#x2019;s book is a fascinating history of American law, of Jewish accomplishment in the American legal field, and of the lives of the Jewish Justices who have served on the Supreme Court.&#x201d; (Rabbi David Wolpe, Sinai Temple (Los Angeles); author of David: The Divided Heart)<br><br>&#x201c;David Dalin has provided an engaging and well written book on the eight Jewish Justices of the Supreme Court. It will be essential reading for students of Supreme Court history, for students of American Jewish history, and for all those who think about the relationship between Jews and the legal profession. Dalin offers a unique perspective on important aspects of American history.&#x201d; (Marshall Breger, Professor of Law, Columbus School of Law at Catholic University)</p><h2>Secret Sisters</h2><p><b>No one does romantic suspense better than Jayne Ann Krentz.

Blood and other matter draining from the terrible head wound soaked the threadbare carpet. His thin, wiry body was crumpled at the foot of the grand staircase that once upon a time had graced the lobby of Aurora Point Hotel.</p><p>He looked up at Madeline with faded blue eyes glazed with shock and blood loss.</p><p>&#x201c;Maddie? Is that you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me, Tom. You&#x2019;ve had a bad fall. Lie still.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I failed, Maddie. I&#x2019;m sorry. Edith trusted me to protect you. I failed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, Tom.&#x201d; Madeline held her wadded-up scarf against the terrible gash on Tom&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m calling nine-one-one. Help will be here soon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Too late.&#x201d; Tom struggled to reach out to her with a clawlike hand that had been weathered and scarred from decades of hard physical labor. &#x201c;Too late.&#x201d;</p><p>The 911 operator was asking for information.</p><p>&#x201c;. . . the nature of your emergency?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m at the Aurora Point Hotel,&#x201d; Madeline said, automatically sliding into her executive take-charge tone. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Tom Lomax, the caretaker. He&#x2019;s had a bad fall. He needs an ambulance immediately.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a vehicle on the way,&#x201d; the operator said. &#x201c;Is he bleeding?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Try to stop the bleeding by applying pressure.&#x201d;</p><p>Madeline looked at the blood-soaked scarf she was using to try to stanch the flood pouring from the wound.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you think I&#x2019;m doing?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Get someone here. Now.&#x201d;</p><p>She tossed the phone down on the floor so that she could apply more pressure to Tom&#x2019;s injury. But she could feel his life force seeping away. His eyes were almost blank.</p><p>&#x201c;The briefcase,&#x201d; he whispered.</p><p>Another shock wave crashed through her.</p><p>&#x201c;Tom, what about the briefcase?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I failed.&#x201d; Tom closed his eyes. &#x201c;Sunrise. You always liked my sunrises.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tom, please, tell me about the briefcase.&#x201d;</p><p>But Tom was beyond speech now. He took one more raspy breath and then everything about him stopped. The utter stillness of death settled on him.</p><p>Madeline realized that the blood was no longer pouring from the wound. She touched bloody fingertips to Tom&#x2019;s throat. There was no pulse.</p><p>A terrible silence flooded the lost-in-time lobby of the abandoned hotel. She knew that Tom was gone, but she had read that the first responder was supposed to apply chest compressions until the medics arrived. She positioned her hands over his heart.</p><p>Somewhere in the echoing gloom a floorboard creaked. She froze, her gaze fixed on the broken length of balcony railing that lay on the threadbare carpet beside the body. For the first time she noticed the blood and bits of hair clinging to it.</p><p>There were probably several scenarios that could explain the blood and hair on the broken railing, but the one that made the most sense was that it had been used to murder Tom.</p><p>The floorboards moaned again. As with the blood and hair on the strip of balcony railing, there were a lot of possible explanations for the creaking sounds overhead. But one of them was that Tom had, indeed, been murdered and the killer was still on the scene.</p><p>She listened intently, hoping to hear sirens, but the wind was picking up now, cloaking sounds in the distance.</p><p>The floorboards overhead groaned again. This time she was almost certain she heard a footstep. Her intuition was screaming at her now.</p><p>Instinctively she turned off the phone so that it would not give away her location if the operator called back. She scrambled to her feet.</p><p>Somewhere on the floor above, rusty door hinges squeaked. One of the doors that allowed access to the upstairs veranda had just opened.</p><p>She looked down at Tom one last time and knew in her heart that there was nothing more she could do for him.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Tom,&#x201d; she whispered.</p><p>Her car was parked in the wide, circular driveway in front. She slung the strap of her heavy tote over one shoulder and sprinted toward the lobby doors.</p><p>The vast, ornate room was drenched in age and gloom. The dusty chandeliers were suspended from the high ceiling like so many dark, frozen waterfalls. The electricity had been cut off eighteen years earlier. When her grandmother had closed the old hotel she had left all the furnishings behind.</p><p>Edith had claimed that the heavy, oversized chairs and end tables, the graceful, claw-footed sofas, and the velvet draperies had been custom designed to suit the Victorian-style architecture and would look out of place anywhere else. But Madeline knew that was not the real reason why they hadn&#x2019;t taken any of the furniture with them. The real reason was that neither of them wanted any reminders of the Aurora Point Hotel.</p><p>In its heyday at the dawn of the twentieth century, the hotel had been a glamorous destination, attracting the wealthy travelers and vacationers of the era. Her grandmother had tried to revive the ambience and atmosphere of that earlier time, but in the end it had proved too expensive. In the wake of the violent night eighteen years ago, there had been no way to get rid of the property. Selling the Aurora Point Hotel was never an option after that night. There were too many secrets buried on the grounds.</p><p>Madeline was halfway across the cavernous space when she saw the shadows shift beneath the rotting velvet curtains that covered one of the bay windows. It could have been a trick of the light caused by the oncoming storm, but she was not about to take a chance. The shadow had looked too much like a partial silhouette of a figure moving very rapidly toward the front doors. It was possible that she had seen the shadow of the killer. The bastard had used the veranda stairs at the back of the building to get down to the ground and was now moving toward the front lobby entrance to intercept her.</p><p>In another moment whoever was out there would come through the lobby doors. She had to assume the worst-case scenario&#x2014;Tom&#x2019;s killer was hunting her.</p><p>Madeline retrieved her keys from her shoulder bag and dropped the tote on the floor. She could hear the muffled thud of running footsteps on the lower veranda now.</p><p>She bolted behind the broad staircase and went down a narrow service hall. She had grown up in the Aurora Point. She knew every inch of the place. In the many decades of its existence it had been remodeled and repaired countless times. The gracious, oversized proportions of the public rooms concealed a warren of smaller spaces that made up the back-of-the-house. There was a large kitchen, a commercial-sized pantry, storage rooms, and the laundry.</p><p>There was also the back stairs that the staff had used to service the guest rooms.</p><p>She summoned up a mental diagram of the layout of the sprawling hotel grounds. It was clear that there was no way to get to her car without being seen by whoever was on the veranda.</p><p>She heard the lobby door open just as she emerged from the small, dark hallway into the pantry. The silence that followed iced her nerves. Most people who happened to walk in on a dead body would have made some noise. At the very least they would be calling 911.</p><p>So much for the fleeting hope that the intruder might be an innocent transient or a high school kid who had stumbled onto the murder scene and was as scared as she was.</p><p>She heard more footsteps&#x2014;long, deliberate strides. Someone was searching the first floor, looking for her. It would be only a matter of time before she was discovered. If the person stalking her was armed, she would not stand a chance of making it to her car.</p><p>She tried to think through a workable strategy. On the positive side, help was on the way. She needed the equivalent of a safe room until the authorities arrived.</p><p>She went to the doorway of the pantry and looked out into the big kitchen. The old appliances loomed like dinosaurs in the shadows. Beyond lay the service stairs that led to the guest rooms on the upper floors.</p><p>She rushed across the kitchen, not even trying to conceal her movements. Her shoes rang on the old tile floor. She knew her pursuer must have heard her.</p><p>Muffled footsteps suddenly pounded across the lobby, heading for the kitchen.</p><p>Madeline opened the door of the service staircase and raced up to the next floor, praying that none of the steps gave way beneath her weight.</p><p>She reached the first landing, turned, and went down the hall. Most of the room doors were closed. She chose one at the far end of the corridor, opened it, and rushed inside.</p><p>Whirling, she slammed the door shut and slid the ancient bolt home. A determined man could kick the door down, but it would take some work.</p><p>She could hear the intruder coming up the service stairs. But her pursuer would have to check the rooms one by one to find her.</p><p>Heart pounding, her breath tight in her chest, she looked down and was vaguely surprised to see that she was still clutching her phone. She stared at it, oddly numb. Very carefully she switched it on and tapped in the emergency number again. She set the phone on the top of a dusty dresser.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t hang up again,&#x201d; the operator said earnestly. &#x201c;The ambulance and police should be there any minute. Are you all right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Madeline said.</p><p>She went to the nearest piece of stout furniture, a heavy armchair, and started to drag it across the room.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you in danger?&#x201d; the operator demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Madeline said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m upstairs in one of the bedrooms. Someone is coming down the hall. He&#x2019;ll be here any second. I&#x2019;ve locked the door but I don&#x2019;t know how long that will stop him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Push something in front of the door.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Great idea,&#x201d; Madeline gasped. She shoved harder on the heavy chair. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t I think of it?&#x201d;</p><p>The big chair seemed to weigh a ton, but it was moving now. She managed to maneuver it in front of the door.</p><p>She heard the footsteps stop outside her room. She grabbed her phone and headed toward the French doors that opened onto the veranda.</p><p>The storm struck just as she stepped outside. Wind-driven rain lashed at her. But she could hear the sirens in the distance.</p><p>She knew the intruder had heard them too because the footsteps were retreating down the hall, heading toward the rear stairs at a run. She knew the killer was headed for the safety of the woods that bordered the rear of the property. She remembered the old service road that wound through the trees.</p><p>A short time later she heard a car engine roar to life. The intruder was gone.</p><p>She reminded herself that there were not a lot of ways off Cooper Island. A private ferry provided service twice a day. There were also floatplanes and charter boats. The local police might have a shot at catching the killer.</p><p>Or not. Most of Cooper Island was undeveloped. A great deal of it was covered in forest. There were plenty of places where a determined murderer could hide until he found a way off the island.</p><p>She rushed to meet the emergency vehicles pulling into the drive. Mentally she made a list of what she could&#x2014;and could not&#x2014;tell the cops.</p><p>She had spent eighteen years keeping secrets. She was good at it.</p></p><h2>Trains</h2><p>Passenger and freight trains are useful, and fun to watch.</p><p>Gail Gibbons &#34;has taught more preschoolers and early readers about the world than any other children&#39;s writer-illustrator,&#34; according to the Washington Post. Winner of the 2010 Regina Award, she has written and illustrated more than fifty books for Holiday House. She lives in Corinth, Vermont.PreSchool-Grade 2 Another fine, boldly illustrated concept book from Gibbons. The author's familiar illustrations in bright, primary colors with crisp, geometric lines will appeal to young eyes, particularly with their neat border of white ``track.'' The text is spare and accurate in its description of different kinds of trains, past and present, and how they work. The final page gives signs and signals related to trains. Gibbons has a knack for discerning what's important to young readers and presenting it in a manner of interest to them. The cover illustration of a huge engine looming high above heightens the sense of a child's perspective in the illustrations. Trains , with its colorful appeal and accurate content, is an example of how information can best be presented to young readers.

But there was a time when these natural treasures were in great danger, all because after years of unrestricted hunting, one key piece of the puzzle had been eliminated-the wolf. <br>Now, more than a decade after scientists realized the wolves' essential role and returned them to Yellowstone, the park's natural balance is gradually being restored. The informative dual-level text and spectacular full-color photographs show the wolves in the natural habitat that was almost lost without them.

The rise and fall and interdependence of species are explained simply in this slim survey of some of the park's wildlife. Patent begins with the Congressional designation of Yellowstone as a national park in 1872, stating that in the early years the geologic wonders rather than the animals were the main attraction. The wolf was a popular hunting target, and its demise led to an overpopulation of elk and coyotes and a complex chain of effects. The format sets small chunks of text and two or three small color photographs on a black background at the far right of the spread. A large color photo fills the remaining space, with a framed sentence superimposed on the picture. The two blocks of text become repetitive, but they're apparently intended as a dual-level text, so that children can read either the briefer explanations on the left or the longer ones opposite. Bits of background terrain are seen in the pictures, but they do not capture the dramatic decline and renewal of the ecosystem suggested. There is no map to indicate the large size and location of Yellowstone. The book concludes with a review quiz with small animal photos.&#x2014;<i>Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She was raised by the tribe and eventually became the wife of a warrior. Twenty-four years after her capture, she was reclaimed by the U.S. cavalry and Texas Rangers and restored to her white family, to die in misery and obscurity. Cynthia Ann's story has been told and re-told over generations to become a foundational American tale. The myth gave rise to operas and one-act plays, and in the 1950s to a novel by Alan LeMay, which would be adapted into one of Hollywood's most legendary films, <i>The Searchers</i>, "The Biggest, Roughest, Toughest... and Most Beautiful Picture Ever Made!" directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne. </p><p>Glenn Frankel, beginning in Hollywood and then returning to the origins of the story, creates a rich and nuanced anatomy of a timeless film and a quintessentially American myth. The dominant story that has emerged departs dramatically from documented history: it is of the inevitable triumph of white civilization, underpinned by anxiety about the sullying of white women by "savages." What makes John Ford's film so powerful, and so important, Frankel argues, is that it both upholds that myth and undermines it, baring the ambiguities surrounding race, sexuality, and violence in the settling of the West and the making of America.</p></p><p><b>Glenn Frankel</b> worked for many years for the <i>Washington Post</i>, winning a Pulitzer Prize in 1989, and taught journalism at Stanford University and the University of Texas at Austin, where he directed the School of Journalism.

So declares George Friedman, chief intelligence officer and founder of Strategic Forecasting, Inc. (Stratfor), a private intelligence agency whose clients include foreign government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. Gathering information from its global network of operatives and analysts (drawing the nickname "the Shadow CIA"), Stratfor produces thoughtful and genuinely engrossing analysis of international events daily, from possible outcomes of the latest Pakistan/India tensions to the hierarchy of Mexican drug cartels to challenges to Obama's nascent administration. In <em>The Next 100 Years</em>, Friedman undertakes the impossible (or improbable) challenge of forecasting world events through the 21st century. Starting with the premises that "conventional political analysis suffers from a profound failure of imagination" and "common sense will be wrong," Friedman maps what he sees as the likeliest developments of the future, some intuitive, some surprising: more (but less catastrophic) wars; Russia's re-emergence as an aggressive hegemonic power; China's diminished influence in international affairs due to traditional social and economic imbalances; and the dawn of an American "Golden Age" in the second half of the century. Friedman is well aware that much of what he predicts will be wrong--unforeseeable events are, of course, unforeseen--but through his interpretation of geopolitics, one gets the sense that Friedman's guess is better than most. <em>--Jon Foro</em><br><p>GEORGE FRIEDMAN&nbsp;is founder and chairman of Geopolitical Futures, which specializes in geopolitical forecasting. Prior to this Friedman was chairman of the global intelligence company Stratfor, which he founded in 1996.

But when John Cross's son racks up an unfathomable gambling debt to Kent's Gents, Cross must pay it back himself. All he has to do is use his inside knowledge of high society mansions and museums to craft a robbery even the smartest detectives won't solve. The take better include some cash too &#x2015;the bigger the payout, the faster this will be over.</p><p>With a newfound talent for sniffing out vulnerable and lucrative targets, Cross becomes invaluable to the gang.

The river of delivery wagons, double-decker omnibuses, and carriages of all description that usually flowed in an unending torrent along West Thirty-Third Street had been reduced to a trickle. In place of the rush of pedestrians along the sidewalk, a few men with umbrellas hurried by the plate glass windows of the Manhattan Merchants &amp; Trust Bank. Customers would hold off coming to the bank until the downpour stopped-and that wasn't going to happen for hours.</p> <p>All of which meant fewer witnesses.</p> <p>Stick Gleason looked down the barrel of his Colt Navy revolver at the people lying facedown on the shiny, white marble floor, then glanced over at Sam Potter, who was standing guard inside the massive oak-and-glass double doors of the front entrance. Potter nodded: things were going well. Though they both wore white muslin masks that hid their faces, Gleason knew Potter was smiling at him.</p> <p>The woman on the floor in front of him started to whimper, reminding him of a hunting dog he'd once owned. When the dog wanted out of his crate, he'd give a high-pitched whine until Gleason couldn't stand the noise any longer and freed him. Gleason could only see the top of the woman's scarlet-colored hat, which had a slanted brim with a sort of high mound on top, like a beehive covered with yellow and green cloth flowers. Must have been a society lady.</p> <p>"Keep quiet, ma'am. We'll be through in just a few minutes," Gleason said in a soothing tone, tapping the top of her hat with the barrel of his Colt. She shut up immediately.</p> <p>He was getting anxious himself. "Come on, Red. How much longer?"</p> <p>"Goddamn you, I told you never to rush me," Bannon said angrily, the words muffled by his muslin mask. He continued to pour the nitroglycerin drop by drop from the small glass vial into the joints of the bank vault's hinges. Beads of sweat slipped down his forehead, sliding over his eyebrows and into his eyes, making him blink uncontrollably. He kept wiping them away with his left hand.</p> <p>It was dead quiet in the bank. Then Gleason heard a faint noise building quickly toward a screech, like a boiling teakettle about to blow.</p> <p>"Listen, woman, I told you..."</p> <p>An ear-piercing scream exploded out of the society lady's mouth. Bannon flinched-and Stick watched in horror as the glass vial slipped from his fingers and fell to the marble.</p> <p>The blast was like a white-hot fireball of a meteorite, streaking from the vault room to the front windows of the bank, incinerating everything in its path. Bannon was vaporized in a millisecond, along with Gleason, the society lady, four bank tellers, two customers, and the entire wood-and-marble interior of the banking hall. Potter was propelled like a rocket into West Thirty-Third Street and through a storefront window directly south across the road.</p> <p>A delivery driver and his bay horse lay dead and bloody amid the wreckage of a dray wagon. A cast-iron electric light pole was bent parallel to the street. Windows and storefronts on the south side of West Thirty-Third were blown in too, leaving black holes that seemed to gape out at the newly silent street in astonishment.</p> <p>� � �</p> <p>James T. Kent, standing under an umbrella on the flat roof of the eight-story Duckworth Building directly across from Manhattan Merchants &amp; Trust, watched as a great plume of black smoke billowed up from West Thirty-Third Street, drifting past him and blending into the gray sky. The street below was a mass of confusion, with people running toward the building from all directions. The clanging of fire wagons could be heard in the distance. There won't be any need for them, Kent thought. The blast had sucked the oxygen out of the space, which meant no fire.</p> <p>From his vantage point, the men on the street looked like ants scurrying in and out of the blasted opening of the bank. They'll find no bodies, he thought. Only tiny pieces of human flesh and bone.</p> <p>"Poor bastards," said Ben Culver, a short, stout, broad-shouldered man.</p> <p>"It was the nitro," Kent said, not a shred of emotion in his voice. "Handling it is like trying to hold quicksilver-almost impossible. But still better than using dynamite. Remember Maritime National? The cash, negotiable bonds, and stock certificates, all burned to ashes by the blast. It took Red hours to sweat out that nitro from a dozen sticks of dynamite. He said blowing the vault would be the easy part."</p> <p>"We'll never replace Bannon, Mr. Kent."</p> <p>"No, we won't. Red was the best cracksman in New York." Kent took a cigar out of his gold case with his black-gloved hand and tapped it idly against his palm.</p> <p>"These vaults are too damn hard to blow in the daytime, Mr. Kent. Bank jobs are just too risky anyhow. The Company has to..."</p> <p>"Diversify?"</p> <p>"Yeah, that's it."</p> <p>"I agree," said Kent with a smile. "What do you suggest?"</p> <p>Kent was a tall, thin man in his early forties, with graying hair and a commanding presence. He always wore a black frock coat with matching waistcoat and pearl-gray trousers, all ordered from Henry Poole &amp; Co., the best tailor in London. He had schooled Culver, whose previous wardrobe could charitably be described as loud, in dress. A gentleman, he'd said, must always be so well dressed that his clothes are never observed at all.</p> <p>Culver valued this advice almost as much as his cut from their jobs. These days, he was as elegantly clothed as his employer, though the juxtaposition of his battered and meaty red face with his fine, tailored outfits frequently struck one as very odd.</p> <p>"The army's stopped guarding President Grant's grave in Riverside Park," he said, brimming over with his excitement at offering a new business proposition. "They just have a night watchman. They haven't started building the real tomb over it either, so we could snatch the body and hold it for ransom. Like they did with A. T. Stewart back in '78. His widow forked over twenty thousand dollars for the body. For a department store king! Think how much we'd get for a United States president."</p> <p>"I can find only two things wrong with your plan," Kent said amiably. "First, I served proudly under Grant in the war. And second...it's incredibly stupid."</p> <p>He smiled and patted Culver on the shoulder, as if to lessen the sting of his words. A disappointed expression twisted Culver's face, and he looked down at his expensive, black patent leather shoes-the ones Kent had advised him to purchase. Culver wasn't the brightest, but he was absolutely the most loyal employee of the Company, and Kent genuinely liked him.</p> <p>"I know those men had families," he said, pulling out his tan pigskin wallet and removing ten one-hundred-dollar bills. "Please divide this among them."</p> <p>"That's very kind of you, Mr. Kent."</p> <p>Kent extracted his Gorham solid-gold pocket watch from his waistcoat and frowned. "The annual board of directors meeting for the Metropolitan Museum is at eleven. I'd best get going."</p></p><h2>The Plot to Kill Hitler: Dietrich Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Spy, Unlikely Hero</h2><p><p>Perfect for fans of suspenseful nonfiction such as books by Steve Sheinkin, this is a page-turning narrative about Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a pastor and pacifist who became an unlikely hero during World War II and took part in a plot to kill Hitler. Written by two-time National Book Award finalist Patricia McCormick, author of <em>Sold </em>and&nbsp;<em>Never Fall Down</em> and coauthor of the young reader&#x2019;s edition of <em>I Am Malala</em>. </p><p>It was April 5, 1943, and the Gestapo would arrive any minute. Dietrich Bonhoeffer had been expecting this day for a long time. He had put his papers in order&#x2014;and left a few notes specifically for Hitler&#x2019;s men to see. Two SS agents climbed the stairs and told the boyish-looking Bonhoeffer to come with them. He calmly said good-bye to his parents, put his Bible under his arm, and left. Upstairs there was proof, in his own handwriting, that this quiet young minister was part of a conspiracy to kill Adolf Hitler.</p><p>This compelling, brilliantly researched account includes the remarkable discovery that Bonhoeffer was one of the first people to provide evidence to the Allies that Jews were being deported to death camps. It takes readers from his privileged early childhood to the studies and travel that would introduce him to peace activists around the world&#x2014;eventually putting this gentle, scholarly pacifist on a deadly course to assassinate one of the most ruthless dictators in history. <em>The Plot to Kill Hitler</em> provides fascinating insights into what makes someone stand up for what&#x2019;s right when no one else is standing with you.&nbsp;It is a question that every generation must answer again and again.</p><p>With black-and-white photographs, fascinating sidebars, and thoroughly researched details, this book should be essential reading.</p></p><p><p>Patricia McCormick is a former journalist and a two-time National Book Award finalist whose books include <em>Cut, Sold, Never Fall Down, The Plot to Kill Hitler</em>, <em>Sergeant Reckless: The True Story of the Little Horse Who Became a Hero</em>, and the young readers edition of <em>I Am Malala</em>.

A legitimate hunter now, Dale Hamm learned the art of market hunting&#x2014; taking waterfowl out of season and selling them to restaurants&#x2014; from his father during the l920s. During the l930s and l940s, he kept his family alive by market hunting. At the peak of his career, Hamm poached every private hunting club along the Illinois River from Havana to Beardstown.<br>After market hunting died out, Hamm became a legendary and almost respected&#x2014; albeit controversial&#x2014; character on the Illinois backwaters. He was eventually invited to hunt on the same clubs from which he had once been chased at the point of a shotgun. He hunted with judges, sheriffs, and the head of undercover operations for the Illinois Department of Conservation, all of whom knew of his reputation. He passed on to these hunting partners a lifetime of outdoor knowledge gained from slogging through mud, falling through ice, hunting ducks at three o&#x2019; clock in the morning, dodging game wardens, and running the world&#x2019; s only floating tavern.<br>"I always said if anyone ever cut open one of us Hamms, all they&#x2019; d find was duck or fish," Hamm once said of his family. Now in his eighties, Hamm still carries a pellet from a shotgun in his chin to remind him of a shotgun blast that ricocheted off the water and into his face. Bakke notes that it is appropriate that a man who spent his life with a shotgun in his hands should carry a bit of buckshot wherever he goes.<br>Everyone who ever met Dale Hamm has a story about him. His own story is that of a one-of-a-kind character who, in his later years, used his considerable outdoor savvy to conserve the natural resources he once savaged. "His time and kind are gone," Bakke notes, "and there will never be another like him."<br>This book will be of interest to anyone who has ever been hunting&#x2014; or who enjoys reading about colorful people and times that exist no more.<br><br></p><p><b>Dale Hamm</b> is a legend among duck hunters. Writing for the Springfield <i>State Journal-Register, </i>David Bakke says, "Tales of the things he has done in the backwaters of the Illinois [River] are legion. Poached ducks from private property? Yes. Shot more than his limit? OK. Out of season? Absolutely."<br><b>David Bakke</b> is the editor of <i>Catholic Times </i>in Springfield, Illinois. An award-winning journalist, he has worked for the <i>State Journal-Register </i>and the <i>Sioux City Journal.<br>&nbsp;<br><br></i>"A day in 1901 at Crane Lake, seven miles west of [Illinois Highway] 78, changed duck hunting forever. That day, four men killed 867 ducks. The next year, in large part owing to that day, the first duck limits were established in the United States. The limit was 50 a day."&#x2014; <b>David Bakke</b>, from the Introduction<br><br></p><h2>The War of the Dwarves (The Dwarves, 2)</h2><p>The dwarves have gone to battle and they have been victorious.

Giles Blunt has a tremendous talent.&#x201d; &#x2014;Tony Hillerman</b><br> &nbsp;<br><b> &#x201c;Forceful . . . surprising . . . [Blunt&#x2019;s] insights into suffering and madness give his characters their true voice.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> In the quiet Canadian town of Algonquin Bay, a frozen body has been found in an abandoned mine shaft. She is quickly identified as Katie Pine, a teenager who had disappeared months ago. At the time, Detective John Cardinal insisted that Katie was no ordinary runaway. His relentless pursuit and refusal to give up on the case got him demoted from Homicide. But now the Canadian police force wants Cardinal back on the case&#x2014;with a new associate by his side. And as these two untrusting partners gather evidence of a serial murder spree, a pair of sociopaths is closing in on the next victim.<br><br><b>Winner of The Macallan Silver Dagger for Fiction</b><br><b>Nominated for the Arthur Ellis Award for Best Novel</b><br> &nbsp;</p><p><blockquote>It gets dark early in Algonquin Bay. Take a drive up Airport Hill at four o' clock on a February afternoon, and when you come back half an hour later the streets of the city will glitter below you in the dark like so many runways. The forty-sixth parallel may not be all that far north; you can be much farther north and still be in the United States, and even London, England, is a few degrees closer to the North Pole. But this is Ontario, Canada, we're talking about, and Algonquin Bay in February is the very definition of winter. Algonquin Bay is snowbound, Algonquin Bay is quiet, Algonquin Bay is very, very cold.</blockquote> Read the evocative opening of Giles Blunt's novel and you may begin to understand why Tony Hillerman says this is the novel he wishes he'd written. Keep reading, and you may wonder why other authors haven't joined the vicarious narrative line. With devastating precision, Blunt effortlessly weaves together strands of lives both led and taken in this tiny Canadian town, limning a hauntingly paradoxical picture of isolation and community, two sides of a fragile bulwark against violence.<p> John Cardinal was taken off homicide investigation after a fruitless and expensive quest for 13-year-old Katie Pine, a Chippewa girl who disappeared from the nearby reservation. After months of insisting that Katie was no runaway, Cardinal receives the cold comfort of vindication in the form of Katie's corpse, discovered in an abandoned mine shaft. But the case, when reopened, becomes a Pandora's box of horror. Katie's body is only the first to be found, as Cardinal uncovers a pattern that links her death to those of two other children. When another boy is reported missing, Cardinal knows he is in a race against time to find the killer (so trite a phrase, while technically accurate, does radical injustice to Blunt's razor-sharp plot and eerily pragmatic balance between the cop and his prey).</p><p> His new partner, Lise Delorme, is trying to uncover her own pattern. Drafted by the RCMP to find proof that Cardinal has been accepting money from drug runner Kyle Corbett to derail the Mounties' investigations (three attempted busts good for absolutely nothing), she sifts through the minutiae of Cardinal's life. Proud father, loving husband, dedicated officer--at what price has this edifice been constructed? Suffice it to say that Cardinal's past and present link him in ironic counterpoint to those people for whom he is inevitably the bearer of bad tidings, leaving them "trying to recognize each other through the smoke and ashes" of grief.</p><p> Blunt has created a world in which every conversation can seem as ominous as the moan of the wind and the bullet-like report of shifting lake ice ("It was a new art form for Delorme, picking shards of fact from the exposed hearts of the bereaved. She looked at Cardinal for help, but he said nothing. He thought, "Get used to it."). But it is also a world whose bleak landscape is touched with unexpected humor. Witness this description of one of the many minor, but always beautifully detailed, characters who populate the novel's pages: "Arthur 'Woody' Wood was not in the burglary business to enhance his social life. Like all professional burglars, he went to great lengths to avoid meeting people on the job. At other times, well, Woody was as sociable as the next fellow." </p><p> Part police procedural, part psychological thriller, part exploration of a region's landscape and people, the novel is an astonishing, powerful hybrid-- worthy of far more than a mere 40 words of praise. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>&#x201c;The highest praise a writer can give another is to say he wishes he had written this book.

However, because he declined to participate in the U.S. Army's military history debriefing program, today he is known only to serious students of the war.<br><br>Drawing heavily on his meticulously kept wartime journals, Balck discusses his childhood and his career through the First and Second World Wars. His memoir details the command decision-making process as well as operations on the ground during crucial battles, including the Battle of the Marne in World War I and his incredible victories against a larger and better-equipped Soviet army at the Chir River in World War II. Balck also offers observations on Germany's greatest generals, such as Erich Ludendorff and Heinz Guderian, and shares his thoughts on international relations, domestic politics, and Germany's place in history. Available in English for the first time in an expertly edited and annotated edition, this important book provides essential information about the German military during a critical era in modern history.</p><p><b>Major General David T. Zabecki, USA (Ret.)</b>, is the author or editor of many books, including the four-volume encyclopedia <i>Germany at War: 400 Years of Military History</i>. He is an honorary senior research fellow in the War Studies Programme at the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom.<br><br><b>Lieutenant Colonel Dieter J. Biederkarken</b>, USA (Ret.), was born and raised in Germany. He attended college in the United States and became an American citizen and a U.S. Army officer."A model translation of one of the leading memoirs from the German Army's mid-level command. Balck takes advantage of being the 'last man standing' to present his version of events and experiences. He makes a solid case between the lines of his narrative for the emphasis on offensive action that consistently informed his approach to tactics and operations."&#x2015;Dennis Showalter, author of <i>Armor and Blood: The Battle of Kursk: The Turning Point of World War II</i><p>"German general Hermann Balck's perspective on war had largely been lost to American scholars. His memoirs, edited by David T. Zabecki and Dieter J. Biedekarken and translated into English for the first time, provide deep insight into his experiences and decision-making during World Wars I and II."&#x2015;<i>Military History</i></p><p>"Hats off to Zabecki and Biedekarken for their excellent translation, intelligent editing, and insightful notes clarifying German idioms, Latin phrases, technical military terms, and obscure references, where necessary. Professional soldiers should read this book, reflect, and be grateful that they are not asked to violate conscience. Students of war, students of German history, and World War II buffs will read it with profit."&#x2015;<i>Journal of Military History</i></p><p>"General Zabecki and Colonel Biedekarken deserve our highest praise for producing the first English language edition of the memoirs of Germany's best panzer division commander in World War II. Balck's fascinating account of his life and his combat experiences in both world wars comes to vivid live in this expertly translated and wonderfully edited book."&#x2015;<i>Armchair General</i></p><p>"Balck's <i>Order in Chaos</i> is an incredible surprise for those seeking fresh discussion on World War I, the interwar years, and World War II. . . . [It] provides vivid accounts of the battles and campaigns in which he led armored forces. His recounting of events is aided tremendously by the twenty superb maps included in this book. He discusses strategy, his decision-making process, the challenges of command, and the human dimension of war. As with his World War I discussion, he shares his opinions on various topics. I found these pages absorbing."&#x2015;<i>Military Review</i></p><p>"This excellent wartime memoir of General of Panzer Troops Hermann Balck (1897-1982), probably 'the greatest German general no one has ever heard of,' . . . brings to life Balck's wartime adventures."&#x2015;<i>Military Officer</i></p><p>"Hermann Balck is considered one of World War II's finest battlefield commanders. For years he resisted sharing his experiences, but finally in 1981, only a year before his death, he published his memoir, using his detailed journals. This work is a thorough and clear translation of that memoir, rendered into readable English. It is a fascinating look at a major German officer's wartime experiences."&#x2015;<i>WWII History</i></p></p><h2>Hate to Want You: Forbidden Hearts (Forbidden Hearts, 1)</h2><p><p><em>Alisha Rai, one of contemporary romance&#x2019;s brightest stars, makes her Avon Books debut with the first novel in the sexy Forbidden Hearts series!</em></p><p>One night.

This is a hands-on book that focuses on the tasks that you or any new business owner must complete in the first 100 days of launching a business. Think of it this way: Imagine you&#39;ve conceived a business idea, written a business plan, raised seed capital, and are set to launch your business on October 1. Now, what would you actually do on October 1, October 2, October 3, and so forth? How would you set your priorities? How would you know which tasks are the most urgent? Although the answers to these questions vary depending on the business, there are a set of key activities that all businesses must accomplish to get their businesses off to a good (and legally proper) start. This book provides examples that include securing proper business licenses and permits; setting up a bookkeeping system; negotiating a lease; buying insurance; entering into contracts with vendors; recruiting and hiring employees; and making the first sale. Broader issues such as developing a business model and building a brand will also be touched upon, but the primary focus of this book is getting you focused on the practical issues that you&#39;ll need, as a new business owner, to accomplish, and accomplish correctly, and to get your business off to a good start. To help you prioritize and track the activities that must be completed at the onset of a business, this book will teach you how to set up a &#39;First 100 Days Plan,&#39; with the template (titled First 100 Days Plan) included in this book.</p><p>Stillwater, OK; Director of the Master&#39;s in Entrepreneurship program; Oklahoma State University; Dr. Barringer is the Johnny D.

Her fist book, Pole Dancing to Gospel Hymns opened the door to Gibson's unapologetic voice, yet The Madness Vase manages to take an even more intimate look at the subjects of family, war, spirituality, gender, grief and hope. The poems&#x2019; topics range from hate crimes to playgrounds, from international conflict to hometowns, from falling in love to the desperation of loneliness. Gibson&#x2019;s work seizes us by the collar and hauls us inside some of her darkest moments, then releases out the other side. Moments later, we find ourselves inhaling words that fill us with light. Her luminous imagery is a buoy that allows us to resurface from her world clutching new possibilities of our own. Throughout her career, Gibson's poems have always been a call to social justice. But this collection goes beyond awareness. Her images linger in our psyches and entreat us to action. They challenge us to grow into our own skin. The journey may be raw at times but we are continuously left inspired, held, and certain we are not alone. By the time you finish reading The Madness Vase, you too will believe, &#x201c;Folks like us/We&#x2019;ve got shoulder blades that rust in the rain/But they are still G-sharp/Whenever our spinal chords are tuned to the key of redemption/So go ahead world/Pick us/To make things better.</p><p>Andrea Gibson is not gentle with their truths. A powerful live performer Gibson is the winner of the 2008 Women's World Poetry Slam, and has placed 3rd in world on two International Poetry Slam stages. Andrea's first book, <i>Pole Dancing to Gospel Hymns</i> won the DIY Poetry Book of the Year and was nominated for the prestigious Pushcart Prize. Gibson has been showcased on Free Speech TV, BBC, Air America, CSPAN, NPR, and was featured in the documentary <i>Slam Planet</i>. Gibson has released four full-length albums and tours over 180 dates/year.&#x201c;..when a war ends, what does that look like exactly?<br>do the cells in the body stop detonating themselves?<br>does the orphanage stop screaming for its mother?<br>when the sand in the desert has been melted down to glass<br>and our reflection is not something we can stand to look at<br>does the white flag make for a perfect blindfold?<br>yesterday i was told a story<br>about this little girl in Iraq, six-years-old,<br>who cannot fall asleep<br>because when she does<br>she dreams of nothing<br>but the day she watched her dog<br>eat her neighbor's corpse.<br>if you told her war is over<br>do you think she can sleep?&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Andrea Gibson, The Madness Vase</p><h2>Horses!</h2><p>No other animal has captured people&#39;s imaginations or changed their lives as has the horse. Their grace, strength, and beauty have made horses sought after as well as useful. What would kings and queens, knights and conquistadores, cowboys and stagecoach drivers, or farmers have done without them? In this informative book, Gail Gibbons relates some of the long history that horses and humans have shared. She looks at horse biology and behavior and includes colorful, clear, and accessible diagrams.</p><p>Gail Gibbons &#34;has taught more preschoolers and early readers about the world than any other children&#39;s writer-illustrator,&#34; according to the Washington Post. Winner of the 2010 Regina Award, she has written and illustrated more than fifty books for Holiday House. She lives in Corinth, Vermont.Kindergarten-Grade 3-Another quality nonfiction title from a veteran author. Gibbons presents an abundance of information about these "powerful, graceful, and majestic animals" in a pleasing and well-organized format. Using succinct and interesting language complemented by colorful and accurate illustrations, she describes the history of horses, their anatomy, how they communicate through sounds and body movement, care and grooming (including the wide range of tools needed to maintain a healthy coat), and different breeds. Finally, readers learn that horses "are good friends and companions." Thoroughbreds, Welsh ponies, Clydesdales, and many others are shown grazing and prancing across the pages, and the carefully placed captions define terminology and often clarify or add to the text. This book will definitely make the winner's circle.<br><i>Carol Schene, Taunton Public Schools, MA</i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Aware that such changes won't happen easily, but that the original Framers fully expected the Constitution to be regularly revised, Sabato urges us to engage in the debate and discussion his ideas will surely engender.

Sabato </b>is the founder and director of the renowned Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. He has appeared on dozens of national television and radio programs, including <i>60 Minutes</i>, <i>Today</i>, <i>Hardball</i>, and <i>Nightline</i>. He has coanchored the BBC's coverage of U.S. presidential returns and inaugurations, and has authored or edited more than a dozen books on American politics, including the highly praised <i>A More Perfect Constitution-Why the Constitution Must Be Revised: Ideas to Inspire a New Generation</i>. His other books include <i>Feeding Frenzy</i>, about press coverage of politicians; <i>The Rise of Political Consultants</i>; and <i>Barack Obama and the New America</i>. Sabato runs the acclaimed Crystal Ball website, which has the most comprehensive and accurate record of election analysis in the country. In 2001, the University of Virginia gave him its highest honor, the Thomas Jefferson Award. He lives in Charlottesville, Virginia.Sabato, founder of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, ventures bravely into the controversial waters of constitutional reform. Sabato argues that the founders never intended the Constitution to be timeless, but rather understood that government structures, ossified by constitutional neglect [can] become fundamentally unfair and tilted to those already in power. Sabato's reforms are consistent with the values he believes underpin the Constitution&#x2014;fairness, idealism, pragmatism and focus on the needs of the present and the future&#x2014;while attempting to mitigate social inequities. His lucid if unorthodox suggestions include a single six-year presidential term that could be extended another two years by referendum; limiting federal and Supreme Court justices to a 15-year term; a larger House of Representatives that would, among other benefits, allow for greater diversity in Congress. His reforms encompass the entire citizenry, who would be required to perform two years of national civilian or military service in what he calls a Bill of Responsibilities. While there's room for skepticism and unintended consequences in some of his suggestions, Sabato makes strong, cogent arguments. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The FWP and the State of Florida jointly published the results as <i>Florida: A Guide to the Southernmost State</i>, which included twenty-two driving tours of the state's main roads. Eventually, after Eisenhower built the interstates, drivers bypassed the small towns that thrived along these roads in favor of making better time. Those main roads are now the state's backroads&#x2015;forgotten by all but local residents, a few commuters, and dedicated road-trippers. Retracing the original routes in the Guide, Cathy Salustri rekindles our notions of paradise by bringing a modern eye to the historic travelogues.</p><p>Salustri's 5,000-mile road trip reveals a patchwork quilt of Florida cultures: startling pockets of history and environmental bliss stitched against the blight of strip malls and franchise restaurants. The journey begins on US 98, heading west toward the Florida/Alabama state line, where coastal towns dot the roadway. Here, locals depend on the tourism industry, spurred by sugar sand beaches, as well as the abundance of local seafood. On US 41, Salustri takes us past the state's only whitewater rapids, a retired carnie town, and a dazzling array of springs, swamps, and rivers interspersed with farms that produce a bounty of fruit. Along US 17, she stops for milkshakes and hamburgers at Florida's oldest diner and visits a collection of springs interconnected by underwater mazes tumbling through white spongy limestone, before stopping in Arcadia, where men still bring cattle to auction. Desperately searching for skunk apes, the Sunshine State's version of Bigfoot, she encounters more than one gator on her way through the Everglades, Ochopee, and the Skunk Ape Research Headquarters.</p><p>Following the original <i>Guide</i>, Salustri crisscrosses the state from the panhandle to the Keys. She guides readers through forgotten and unknown corners of the state--nude beaches, a rattlesnake cannery, Devil's Millhopper in Gainesville--as well as more familiar haunts--Kennedy Space Center and The Villages, "Florida&#x2019;s Friendliest Retirement Hometown." Woven through these journeys are nuggets of history, environmental debates about Florida's future, and a narrative that combines humor with a strong affection for an oft-maligned state.</p><p>Today, Salustri urges, tourists need a new nudge to get off the interstates or away from Disney in order to discover the real Florida. Her travel narrative, following what are now backroads and scenic routes, guides armchair travelers and road warriors alike to historic sites, natural wonders, and notable man-made attractions--comparing the past views with the present landscape and commenting on the changes, some barely noticeable, others extreme, along the way.</p></p><p>&#x201c;Funny, salty . . . informative and poignant.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i><b>Creative Loafing Tampa</b></i><b>Cathy Salustri</b> is the arts and entertainment editor at <i>Creative Loafing Tampa</i> and lives in Gulfport, Florida.</p><h2>Dragonwyck</h2><p><b>&#x201c;There was, on the Hudson, a way of life such as this, and there was a house not unlike Dragonwyck.&#x201d;</b><br><br>In the spring of 1844 the Wells family receives a letter from a distant relative, the wealthy landowner Nicholas Van Ryn. He invites one of their daughters for an extended visit to his Hudson Valley estate, Dragonwyck. Eighteen-year-old Miranda, bored with the local suitors and her commonplace life on the farm, leaps at the chance for escape. She immediately falls under the spell of Nicholas and his mansion, mesmerized by its Gothic towers, flowering gardens, and luxurious lifestyle&#x2014;unaware of the dark, terrible secrets that await. <br><br>Anya Seton masterfully tells the heart-stopping story of a remarkable woman, her extraordinary passions, and the mystery that resides in the magnificent hallways of Dragonwyck.</p><p>ANYA SETON (1904&#x2013;1990) was the author of many best-selling historical novels, including <i>Katherine, Avalon, Dragonwyck, Devil Water,</i> and <i>Foxfire</i>. She lived in Greenwich, Connecticut.<b><i>One</i></b> <br>It was on an afternoon in May of 1844 that the letter came from Dragonwyck.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Mead boys had seen it lying in the Horseneck post office, and had thoughtfully carried it with him three miles up the Stanwich road to deliver it at the Wells farmhouse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the letter came, Miranda was, most regrettably, doing not one of the tasks which should have occupied the hour from two to three.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was not in the springhouse churning butter, she was not weeding the vegetable patch, nor even keeping more than half an absent-minded eye on Charity, the baby, who had kicked off her blanket and was chewing on a blade of sweet meadow grass, delighted with her freedom.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miranda had hidden behind the stone wall in the quiet little family burying-ground on the north side of the apple orchard as far from the house as possible. It was her favorite retreat. The seven tombstones which marked graves of her father&#x2019;s family were no more than seven peaceful friends. Even the tiny stone in the corner beneath the giant elm had no tragic significance though it was marked, &#x201c;Daniel Wells, son of Ephraim and Abigail Wells, who departed this life April 7th, 1836, aged one year,&#x201d; and covered the body of her baby brother. Miranda had been ten during little Danny&#x2019;s short life, and he was now nothing but a gently poignant memory.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miranda was curled up against the wall, her pink calico skirts bunched carelessly above her knees in uncharacteristic abandon. A green measuring worm inched himself unchecked across the smooth bodice of her dress. The May breeze, fragrant with appleblossoms and clover from the adjacent pasture, blew her loosened hair into her eyes. She pushed the strand back impatiently with one hand while the other clutched her book, as Miranda devoured the fascinating pages of &#x201c;The Beautiful Adulteress.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So compelling were the beautiful adulteress&#x2019;s adventures, that even when Miranda&#x2019;s sunbonnet slipped off and hot sunshine fell through the elm trees onto her skin, she did not pause to replace the bonnet. And yet the transparent whiteness of that skin was the envy of her friends and part product of many a tedious treatment with buttermilk and cucumber poultices.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;The Beautiful Adulteress&#x201d; had been lent by Phoebe Mead, and it must be finished by nightfall so that Phoebe could return it to Deborah Wilson, who had purloined it from her brother&#x2019;s saddlebag.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite Miranda&#x2019;s eighteen years and elegant education at Philander Button&#x2019;s Greenwich Academy, despite avid perusal of this and similar books, she had not the vaguest notion of the horrifying behavior that resulted in one&#x2019;s becoming an adulteress. But that point was immaterial.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the glorious palpitating romance that mattered. The melancholy heroes, the languishing heroines, the clanking ghosts, dismal castles and supernatural lights; all entrancingly punctuated at intervals by a tender, a rapturous&#x2014;but in any case a guilty&#x2014;kiss.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her mother&#x2019;s first call went unheard. It was not until the cry &#x201c;Ranny&#x2014;&#x201d; changed to a louder and sharper &#x201c;Miranda-a-a! Where in tunket are you?&#x201d; that the girl jumped. She shoved the book between two stones in the wall, and called hastily, &#x201c;Coming, Ma!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She brushed bits of grass and drifted appleblossom off her dress and apron, straightened the black mesh net which confined her masses of soft curling hair during the work day, hair that in the sunlight shone nearly as golden as the buttercups in the pasture behind her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she picked up Charity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, shame, lambkin, you&#x2019;re wet again,&#x201d; she said reproachfully.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby at once set up an anguished yell; even at a year she resented criticism.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miranda laughed and kissed the soft neck. &#x201c;Never mind, pet. Sister isn&#x2019;t really cross.&#x201d; But she sighed, rapidly checking the chores which must be done before dusk.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a big batch of the baby&#x2019;s never-ending diapers to be washed and sunned, the butter to be churned, and, worst of all, a fowl to be slaughtered, plucked, and drawn for the Sabbath dinner tomorrow. Miranda loathed this particular task above all others. The sight of blood sickened her. And whereas her brothers and sister found the antics of the staggering, decapitated chicken funny, Miranda always felt a little spasm of nausea. Equally unpleasant was the later necessity for plunging one&#x2019;s hand into the chicken&#x2019;s slimy entrails.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She usually spent quite ten minutes scrubbing her slender white fingers afterward. A process which Ephraim, her father, viewed with disapproval when he caught her at it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Quite die finicking young lady, aren&#x2019;t we, Ranny!&#x201d; he growled, frowning at her beneath his bushy eyebrows. &#x201c;The Lord has mercifully provided us with food, and He has no patience with those who think themselves too fine to prepare it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ephraim always knew what the Lord was thinking or feeling quite as well as the Reverend Coe did.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miranda assumed that her mother&#x2019;s summons had to do with the chicken and she walked slowly, shifting the heavy baby from arm to arm and avoiding the barnyard where the destined victim clucked in happy ignorance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she walked, she noted absently that the north potato field was deserted and that therefore her father and three brothers must have finished the spraying and moved on ahead of schedule to the great field by Strickland brook. She also noted that the distant blue of the Sound was unusually clear and that she could even see the wooded purplish strip of Long Island on the horizon. That meant rain. But otherwise she saw nothing of the beauty of the rolling Connecticut countryside, the flowering meadows, the rustling wineglass elms and hemlocks greenish-black against the sky. The farm and the sturdy six-room farmhouse were simply home, and she had never been farther than ten miles away from them in her life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she entered the dark kitchen, she saw with relief that her mother&#x2019;s gaunt though still handsome face showed neither annoyance at Miranda&#x2019;s tardiness, nor even the habitual pucker of admonition with which she urged her children on to the next inevitable chore.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abigail, who seldom rested from morning till night, was sitting on a reed-bottomed chair and staring at a paper which lay unfolded on the kitchen table.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up as her daughter came in. &#x2018;Here&#x2019;s a strange thing, Ranny. I don&#x2019;t know what to make of it. Can&#x2019;t tell till I&#x2019;ve talked with your pa.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miranda followed her mother&#x2019;s puzzled gaze to the paper on the table. &#x201c;Why, it&#x2019;s a letter, isn&#x2019;t it!&#x201d; she cried with lively interest. Not three letters a year came to the Wells farm. &#x201c;Can I read it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I guess so,&#x201d; said Abigail. &#x201c;But change the baby first, then knead down the bread dough while I nurse her. Time&#x2019;s wasting.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl cast a longing glance at the mysterious letter, but she did as she was told. Abigail flew around the kitchen, cutting bacon with quick, decisive stabs, poking at the embers beneath the oven where the bread would soon be baked. Finally she unbuttoned her bodice, snatched up the hungry baby, and settled on the low nursing chair.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dough was set to rise again, Miranda seized the letter. She examined the envelope first. The thick creamy paper was pleasant and unfamiliar as was the bold, rather illegible writing unadorned by the copper-plate flourishes or shaded capitals which she had painstakingly learned at the Academy. The envelope was addressed: <br>To Mistress Abigail Wells<br>The Stanwich Road<br>Horseneck, (or Greenwich)<br>Connecticut. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was postmarked &#x201c;Hudson, New York,&#x201d; which conveyed nothing to Miranda, who had never heard of the place. But as she put down the envelope and picked up the letter a thrill of excitement ran through her. It was an intuitive flash of certainty that this bland piece of paper was of importance to her, and, though this intuition was pleasurable, it also contained a fleeting apprehension. She read eagerly. <br>Dragonwyck, May 19th, 1844. <br>My dear Cousin Abigail:<br>Though we have never met, we are related, as you doubtless know, through our mutual grandmother, Annetje Gaansevant.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife and I, having discussed the matter at some length, have decided to invite one of your daughters into our home for an extended visit. We shall naturally be able to offer her many advantages which she could not hope to enjoy in her present station. In return, if she pleases, she may occasionally occupy herself with the teaching of our six-year-old child, Katrine, but she will in all ways be treated as befits my kins-woman.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had inquiries made and was gratified to find that you and your husband enjoy the honor and respect of your little community. Be so good as to let me know at your earliest convenience which of your daughters you select, and I will make all suitable arrangements for her journey to Dragonwyck.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe me, madam, your sincere friend and cousin. Respectfully yours,<br>Nicholas Van Ryn <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miranda read the letter twice before turning in amazement to her mother. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand this at all, Ma. Who in the world is Nicholas Van Ryn?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;He is, I believe, a very grand personage,&#x201d; answered Abigail with a half-smile. &#x201c;He is lord of a large manor up on the Hudson River somewhere near Albany.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re his cousin?&#x201d; persisted Miranda, still more astonished.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;It would seem so,&#x201d; replied Abigail dryly. &#x201c;I remember my mother telling me of the Van Ryns, though I haven&#x2019;t thought of them in years. Bring me the Patterson Bible.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miranda moved toward the shelf where her father kept his ponderous Bible.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;No, not that one, child,&#x201d; Abigail stopped her. &#x201c;That one has no records from my side. I want the Bible I brought with me at my marriage. It&#x2019;s in the attic next your Grandfather Patterson&#x2019;s musket and powder horn.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Miranda had brought the great gilt-edged volume, they examined the records on the fly leaves between the Old and New Testaments.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was clear enough. Annetje Gaansevant of Rensselaer County, New York, had in 1779 married Adriaen Van Ryn, patroon of the Van Ryn manor, and borne him a son, Cornelius, who must be the father of Nicholas.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then after Adriaen Van Ryn&#x2019;s death, Annetje had married again, a Connecticut Yankee named Patterson, and thereupon produced a great many children, the eldest of whom had been Abigail&#x2019;s mother.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;So this Nicholas&#x2019; grandmother is also my great-grandmother,&#x201d; cried Miranda at last. &#x201c;I had no idea I had such fine relations.&#x201d; She looked down at her tapering hands. She had always privately thought them aristocratic, and it was pleasant to have confirmation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t a scrap of Van Ryn blood,&#x201d; snorted Abigail, &#x201c;so you needn&#x2019;t go puffing like a peacock. The connection is only through the Gaansevants; Dutch farmers they were like ourselves. And it&#x2019;s just as well, for the Van Ryns are a wild, strange lot with some kind of a skeleton in their closet, for all their money and land and hoity-toity ways.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Truly, Ma?&#x201d; cried Miranda, her hazel eyes sparkling. &#x201c;How vastly romantic! Do tell me, please.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abigail shifted the baby to the other arm. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know anything to tell. You and your &#x2018;vastly romantic&#x2019;! You&#x2019;ve a head stuffed with nonsense now.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;But you must know something about this Nicholas who writes the letter. I suppose he&#x2019;s quite an old man; it&#x2019;s a pity his birth date isn&#x2019;t in the Bible.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, he&#x2019;s somewhere in middle life, I guess,&#x201d; said Abigail. &#x201c;About my age. And I know nothing about him except that he has great estates and a town house in New York, and that four years ago, when Van Buren was President, Nicholas often visited at the White House, for I read about it in a newspaper.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, Ma&#x2014;&#x201d; breathed Miranda, quite overcome. &#x2018;He must be very grand indeed.&#x201d; She considered these revelations for a moment, then she burst out, &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t said a word about his letter, the invitation.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clasped her hands together in a suddenly childish gesture. &#x201c;Oh, but wouldn&#x2019;t I love to go!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;And if we should send a daughter, which I think unlikely, why should it be you, miss?&#x201d; asked Abigail. &#x201c;Why not Tibby, I&#x2019;d like to know?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miranda frowned. Tabitha was sixteen and even now at the Academy finishing her last term. There was no reason why she should not be chosen except that Miranda felt that she could not bear it if she were.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Tibby wouldn&#x2019;t want to go,&#x201d; she said slowly. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not like me. She doesn&#x2019;t &#x2014; &#x201d; Her voice trailed off. Impossible to explain that Tabitha did not hunger after romance, change, adventure, as Miranda did. That she actually enjoyed cooking and washing and housekeeping, that she asked for nothing better in life than to settle down on the next farm with young Obadiah Brown and likely have a parcel of babies right off. But I&#x2019;m different. I am, thought Miranda passionately.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abigail watched her daughter and read some of these thoughts on the downcast face. Though she would never have admitted it, her firstborn girl was closest of all to her heart. She secretly gloried in Miranda&#x2019;s delicate, small-boned beauty, in her fastidiousness and dainty ways. She thought her remarkably like one of those exquisite creatures in Godey&#x2019;s Lady&#x2019;s Book, the same graceful height, small nose, and full, pouting lips.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pretended not to see when Miranda fussed over her complexion, guarding its pink and whiteness from freckles or sunburn with as much anxious care as might a fashionable New York lady. And she sympathized with the girl&#x2019;s restlessness and vague youthful dreams. Abigail had had them, too, long ago before she married the estimable Ephraim and life flattened into a monotony of never-ending work and baby-tending.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So,&#x201d; she said with her normal crispness, &#x201c;just like that, and with your usual lack of prudent thought, you &#x2018;want to go.&#x2019; You don&#x2019;t consider whether I might be able to spare you, nor do you even seem to think that you might miss us here.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miranda looked up, stricken. She rushed across the room and put her arms around her mother&#x2019;s thin shoulders, resting her cheek on the brown head that was already finely threaded with gray. &#x201c;Oh, Ma, dear, of course I&#x2019;d miss you. It&#x2019;s just that&#x2014;that it seems so rarely exciting an opportunity.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abigail smiled faintly, and Miranda knew that, whether or not she would be allowed to go to Dragonwyck, there would be no real question of Tabitha&#x2019;s going.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her mother straightened, buttoned her bodice, and placed the sleeping baby in the cradle. Then she seized the holystone and began scouring the oak drain board. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll say no more about the matter now. Hurry up and kill that old white hen; she&#x2019;ll be a mite tough, but the others are laying well, and she&#x2019;ll have to do.&#x201d; She glanced at the Seth Thomas banjo clock that was her great pride. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re shockingly behind with the work. The men will be in from the fields before supper&#x2019;s near ready.&#x201d;</p><h2>Straight on Till Morning: The Life of Beryl Markham</h2><p><p><strong>The <em>New York Times</em> bestseller: &#x201c;Every page is filled with revelations, gossip and fascinating details about Markham.&#x201d;&#x2015;Diane Ackerman, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em></strong></p> Born in England and raised in Kenya, Beryl Markham was a notorious beauty.

By appointing his close associates as heads of state enterprises and by giving control of the FSB and the judiciary to his friends from the KGB, he has enriched his business friends from Saint Petersburg with preferential government deals. Thus, Putin has created a super wealthy and loyal plutocracy that owes its existence to authoritarianism.<br> &nbsp;<br> Much of this wealth has been hidden in offshore havens in the United States and the United Kingdom, where companies with anonymous owners and black money transfers are allowed to thrive. Though beneficial to a select few, this system has left Russia&#x2019;s economy in untenable stagnation, which Putin has tried to mask through military might.</p><p><b>Anders �slund</b> is a leading specialist on economic policy in Russia, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University&#x2019;s School of Foreign Service.&nbsp;&#x201c;Superb book&#x201d;&#x2014; Martin Wolf, Financial Times<br>&#x201c;An excellent read.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ariel Cohen, <i>Forbes.com</i><br>&#x201c;An insightful and authoritative guide to Russia&#x2019;s economy since the fall of communism by the foremost Western expert on the subject.&#x201d;&#x2014;Daniel Treisman, Professor of Political Science, University of California, Los Angeles<br>&#x201c;Anders �slund&#x2019;s economic analysis is impeccable.

It reveals the challenges and excitement of this time, as this field sorts through the psychoanalytic and attachment theories of its origins, integrates emerging neuroscience and epigenetic theories whose applications to practice are still being worked out, to stake out its territory, tests its boundaries, and develops its own identity. More than that, this collection suggests a truly transdisciplinary path for a whole new kind of field, born from a range of others, that is creating new meanings and possibilities at their intersections for babies, families, clinicians, systems of care, researchers and policy-makers. --Joshua Sparrow, M.D., Harvard Medical School, Boston Children's Hospital<br><br>For those of us who work daily with parents who never smile at their baby and have no idea how to play, this book explains the reasons for their parenting deficits, the effects of those deficits on the baby, and the interventions that we need to implement to help them become good enough parents. The giants in the field of infant mental health have created this comprehensive volume that so vividly brings the research to life in a way that practitioners can understand and appreciate. I know I will make better decisions for the families in my courtroom as a result of reading this book. --Cindy S. Lederman, J.D., Circuit Court Judge, Eleventh Judicial Circuit Juvenile Justice Center<br><br>There has been an urgent need for a practically oriented book that integrates the modern understanding of mind with a hands-on guide to early childhood interventions. This is the book to bring about this integration. It is simply the best book that provides a pragmatic approach to support frontline clinicians at the same time as conveying the complexity of ideas that must guide such interventions. It is a beautifully written, comprehensive, user-friendly guide that will run into many reprints and editions. --Peter Fonagy, Ph.D., FBA, Freud Memorial Professor of Psychoanalysis and Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London; Chief Executive, The Anna Freud Centre</p><h2>Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces: Second Edition (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>A fine example of a great mathematician's intellect and mathematical style, this classic on linear algebra is widely cited in the literature. The treatment is an ideal supplement to many traditional linear algebra texts and is accessible to undergraduates with some background in algebra. <br>"This is a classic but still useful introduction to modern linear algebra. It is primarily about linear transformations ... It's also extremely well-written and logical, with short and elegant proofs. ... The exercises are very good, and are a mixture of proof questions and concrete examples. The book ends with a few applications to analysis ... and a brief summary of what is needed to extend this theory to Hilbert spaces." &#x2014; Allen Stenger, <i>MAA Reviews,</i> maa.org, May, 2016.<br>"The theory is systematically developed by the axiomatic method that has, since von Neumann, dominated the general approach to linear functional analysis and that achieves here a high degree of lucidity and clarity. The presentation is never awkward or dry, as it sometimes is in other 'modern' textbooks; it is as unconventional as one has come to expect from the author. The book contains about 350 well-placed and instructive problems, which cover a considerable part of the subject. All in all this is an excellent work, of equally high value for both student and teacher." &#x2014; <i>Zentralblatt f�r Mathematik.</i></p><p>Hungarian-born Paul R.

What is their function and what do they mean? <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> Robert Segal introduces the array of approaches used to understand the study of myth. These approaches hail from disciplines as varied as anthropology, sociology, psychology, literary criticism, philosophy, science, and religious studies. Including ideas from theorists as varied as Sigmund Freud, Claude Levi-Strauss, Albert Camus, and Roland Barthes, Segal uses the famous ancient myth of Adonis to analyse their individual approaches and theories. <br><br>In this new edition, he not only considers the future study of myth, but also considers the interactions of myth theory with cognitive science, the implications of the myth of Gaia, and the differences between story-telling and myth.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong><br>The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly.

He taught at Lancaster University, before moving in 2006 to the University of Aberdeen, where he is Sixth Century Chair in Religious Studies. He teaches and writes on theories of myth and on theories of religion. Among the books he has written or edited are <em>Joseph Campbell</em> (1987, 1990) <em>The Gnostic</em> <em>Jung</em> (1992), <em>Jung on Mythology</em> (1998), <em>The Myth and Ritual Theory</em> (1998), <em>Theorizing about Myth</em> (1999), <em>The Blackwell Companion to the Study of Religion</em> (2006), and <em>30-Second Mythology</em> (2012). He is currently editing the Oxford Handbook of Myth Theory.<br><br>"The volume fulfills its function admirably, it is a pleasure to read, and Segal's grasp of myth theories, as well as his ability to present them lucidly, is impressive. It is refreshing to read an author who takes all the myth theorists that he discusses quite seriously and explains them clearly, but who engages his materials from a keen theoretical point of view, always with a view to logical inconsistencies and gaps in the argumentation." -- Laura Feldt, <em>Religion &amp; Theology</em><p></p><br>"This small yet extremely rich volume, now in its second edition and having been translated into a variety of European and non-European languages, can today be regarded as a classic." -- Angus Nicholls, <em>Religion</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Oxford Essential Russian Dictionary: Russian-English, English-Russian</h2><p>The Oxford Essential Russian Dictionary is a new compact Russian-English and English-Russian dictionary that offers up-to-date coverage of all the essential day-to-day vocabulary with over 40,000 words and phrases and 60,000 translations.

They had shared the perils of the Peruvian adventure with Pizarro in the same boat in which he and his men sailed south through the Pacific. Missionaries of many other orders followed them: Franciscans, Augustinians, Mercedarians, Jesuits. But divine Providence reserved for the first missionary workers the finest fruits of the seed of the Gospel sown between the seacoast and the forbidding heights of the Andes.<br><br>Born shortly after the founding of Lima, Martin entered the Dominican Order early in life. There he spent the remainder of his 60 years in complete dedication to his order and the cause of the poor, sick and neglected of Lima while growing to the highest levels of sanctity and humility. The appeal of St. Martin de Porres is universal. Called an apostle of charity, patron of social justice, father of the sick and poor, and helper in hopeless cases, he is a powerful intercessor to those in need. <br><br> The close friend of St. Rose of Lima; he became a Dominican lay brother at 15 and spent his life (died at 61) helping those in need. Many great anecdotes telling how he raised the dead; multiplied food; cured the sick; healed wounded animals; visited those in need through bilocation; did extreme penance and gained the name of Apostle of Charity; patron of social justice; father of the sick and poor and helper in hopeless cases.<br><br> <b>ST MARTIN DE PORRES: APOSTLE OF CHARITY</b> was written in 1957 at the request of the Postulation of the Dominican Order at Santa Sabina, Rome. Following the canonization of St. Martin in 1963, the author added new material especially for the English translation to make it as definitive as possible. The efforts of Giuliana Cavallini met with such praise and satisfaction that Most Reverend Aniceto Fernandez, O.P. selected this book as an official biography of St. Martin de Porres.</p><p>Giuliana Cavallini, O.P., was the Director of the Centro Nazionale di Studi Cateriniani in Rome, as well as an editor of St. Catherine of Siena s dialogue and author of additional works on the saint. She purposefully wrote her biography of <i>St. Martin de Porres</i> as a story neither chronological nor critical. Rather, she gathered various episodes taken from the testimony given during the process of his beatification, from people who had known Martin in his lifetime. The completed work received the Imprimatur from Cletus F. O Donnell, and was originally published in 1963. Giuliana Cavallini is also the author of <i>Things Visible and Invisible: Images in the Spirituality of St. Catherine of Siena</i>.</p><h2>Lightning Over The Treasury Building: An Expose Of Our Banking And Currency Monstrosity, America&#39;s Most Reprehensible And Un-American Racket</h2><p>Format Paperback Subject Literary Collections</p><p></p><h2>The Esoteric Philosophy of Love and Marriage</h2><p><p>Dion Fortune's basic esoteric textbook on the psychology of love and relationships gives a simple explanation of the universal factors governing interaction between masculine and feminine, from the "lowest" to the "highest" level of the Seven Planes. An important work for Dion Fortune collectors.</p></p><p>Kessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.Dion Fortune's basic esoteric textbook on the psychology of love and relationships explains the universal factors governing the interaction between masculine and feminine, from the "lowest" to the "highest" level of the Seven Planes. With uncanny intuition and hands-on psychological experience, Fortune clearly states the principles of polarity underlying all relationships between men and women.<p>She explains that sex is a function, not an ideal, with many factors that produce or hinder harmony. The feminine is "positive" on the Spiritual and Emotional Planes, while the male tends to be "positive" on the Mental and Physical Planes. In a harmonious union, these aspects complement each other so the relationship stays balanced. Where these aspects are unrecognized or denied free expression, disharmony often results. Needless to say, the physical expression through sex will also suffer, since attitudes derived from the "higher levels" control or inhibit the "lower physical aspect". These principles remain as true today as when this book was first published. Also included is Fortune's teaching on some of the esoteric principles behind abstinence and asceticism, contraception and abortion.</p></p><h2>How to Write Short Stories And Use Them to Further Your Writing Career (Bell on Writing)</h2><p><b>Now, learn the master key for writing great short stories, and the strategies for using them to advance your writing career</b><p></p><p>As most writers will tell you, the hardest fiction form to master is the short story.

Harris place sexuality at the center of slavery studies in the Americas (the United States, the Caribbean, and South America). While scholars have marginalized or simply overlooked the importance of sexual practices in most mainstream studies of slavery, Berry and Harris argue here that sexual intimacy constituted a core terrain of struggle between slaveholders and the enslaved. These essays explore consensual sexual intimacy and expression within slave communities, as well as sexual relationships across lines of race, status, and power. Contributors explore sexuality as a tool of control, exploitation, and repression and as an expression of autonomy, resistance, and defiance.</p><p>An examination of the many facets of sexuality within slave communities<b>Daina Ramey Berry (Editor) </b><br> DAINA RAMEY BERRY is the Oliver H.

Year after year, Linus faces his persecution and inevitable disappointment with either blind faith or Quixotic perseverance. Charles M. Schulz&#x2019;s homage to the power of idealism and belief makes these some of the most beloved comic strips of all time.</p><p>Charles M. Schulz was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip Barney Google).In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 Ripley's Believe It or Not! installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the Saturday Evening Post&#x2015;as well as, to the local St. Paul Pioneer Press, a weekly comic feature called Li'l Folks. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, Li'l Folks. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become Peanuts&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first Peanuts daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from Peanuts at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.&#x201c;This adorable little collection of strips is the perfect prize for your costume contest.

With his 80th birthday on the horizon in January 2019 and a career spanning over 50 years, Gibson is at a point of reflection in his life and work and decided to put pen to paper.</p><p>Writing in candid prose, Gibson takes the reader through his life and career from his earliest memories of growing up in California (the son of a Hollywood director, Gibson's childhood is touched by the old glamour of the silver screen: the likes of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth make appearances) to his time in the navy and his continuous love affair with photography.</p><p>Gibson's memories are filled with rich characters and period details. Often moving, the narratives of his at times troublesome childhood provide a rich background to the charismatic artist Gibson has become. Gibson covers a range of topics such as music, Catholicism, his wife, Mary Jane, and a long line of fellow artists and photographers such as Dorothea Lange and Robert Frank. His ruminations on his life so far display a deep, thoughtful understanding and self-awareness that make this book a fascinating read in itself as well as an illuminating companion to his work.</p><p>What emerges is an insight into the mind of an incredible, highly decorated artist. Evocatively illustrated, <i>Self-Exposure</i> presents Gibson's life story alongside his photographic work. Designed and produced in close collaboration with Gibson, this large-format publication&#x2015;as much a biography as it is an artist's book&#x2015;is Gibson's most personal book to date.</p><p><b>Ralph Gibson</b> was born in Los Angeles in 1939. In 1956 he enlisted in the navy, where he began studying photography. His work is widely exhibited and held in public collections around the world, such as the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, and the Museum of Modern Art, New York. He lives and works in New York.</p></p><p></p><h2>Experiencing the Cross Study Guide: Your Greatest Opportunity for Victory Over Sin</h2><p><b>Dare to Go There </b> <br><br>Although the cross is God&#x2019;s decisive deed in human history, the full meaning of it is far too much for a mere human mind to grasp. But through Henry Blackaby&#x2019;s careful examination, the cross becomes not a doctrine, but an experience. You&#x2019;ll be overwhelmed with the utter significance of Christ&#x2019;s death, leading you to a stronger sense of God&#x2019;s power in your daily life. Steeped in the Blackaby distinctive of constant encouragement toward your personal experience of God, and firmly rooted in Scripture, this study guide makes it impossible to keep a casual attitude toward sin. Practice surrendering to the deeper dimensions of the cross, so that nothing can block the Lord&#x2019;s presence and power in your life! <br><br><b>&#x201c;Whoever does not bear his own cross </b> <br><br><b>and come after me cannot be my disciple.&#x201d;</b> <br><br><b>Luke 14:27</b> <br><br>Are you ready to destroy a casual attitude toward sin?

It was there that God dealt totally with sin. And it is there that God intends us to be united with Christ in His death so that we would forever hate sin, abhor sin, and forsake sin. In our intimate relationship with Christ and His crucifixion, God intends for us to obtain His perspective on sin&#x2014;to feel its horrors, as Christ does, and then to let God put sin to death in our lives&#x2014;as He did in the crucifixion of His Son. The victory accomplished through Christ&#x2019;s death and resurrection is the very same victory we can experience daily in our lives!&#x201d; <br><br>&#x2014;Henry Blackaby</p><p>Henry T.

She beats her own drum and sews her own crop tops. A gifted equestrian, she&#x2019;s half dog, half coyote, and all power. With the help of her trusty steed, Red, there&#x2019;s not much that&#x2019;s too big for her to bite off, chew up, and spit out right into your face, if you deserve it. But when Coyote and Red find themselves on the run from a trio of vengeful bad dogs, get clobbered by arrows, and are tragically separated, our protagonist is left fighting for her life and longing for her displaced best friend. Taken in by a wolf clan, Coyote may be wounded, but it&#x2019;s not long before she&#x2019;s back on the open road to track down Red and tackle the dogs who wronged her. </p><p>An homage to and a lampoon of Westerns like <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i>, Lisa Hanawalt&#x2019;s <i>Coyote Doggirl</i> is a self-aware, playful subversion of tropes. As our fallible hero attempts to understand the culture of the wolves, we see a journey in understanding and misunderstanding, adopting and co-opting. Uncomfortable at times but nonetheless rewarding and empowering, the story of these flawed, anthropomorphized characters is nothing if not relentlessly hilarious and heartbreakingly human. Told in Hanawalt&#x2019;s technicolor absurdist style, <i>Coyote Doggirl</i> is not just a send-up of the Western genre but a deeply personal story told by an enormously talented cartoonist.</p></p><p><b>Lisa Hanawalt</b> is the producer and production designer of the Netflix original series <i>BoJack Horseman</i>.

What&#x2019;s especially interesting to me, however, is how Coyote's tone refuses to stay put, venturing from slapstick to poignant, and finally into downright bleak territory, appropriate for a Western. Her deftness with color is also worth study.

The central purpose of Antonia Fraser&#39;s book is the recreation of his life and character, freed from the distortions of myth and Royalist propaganda. Cromwell was a man of contradictions and surprising charm. This decisive and ruthless commander was also a country gentleman and a passionate connoisseur of music. Of Cromwell&#39;s fitness for high office, this fascinating biography leaves no doubt. Under his rule English prestige abroad rose to a level unequalled since Elizabeth I, yet his campaign in Ireland has cast a shadow over his reputation. Antonia Fraser displays great insight into this complex man and reveals a totally unexpected Cromwell, far removed from the received stereotype.</p><p>Antonia Fraser is the author of many widely acclaimed historical works, including the biographies MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS (a 40th anniversary edition was published in May 2009), CROMWELL: OUR CHIEF OF MEN, KING CHARLES II and THE GUNPOWDER PLOT (CWA Non-Fiction Gold Dagger; St Louis Literary Award). She has written five highly praised books which focus on women in history, THE WEAKER VESSEL: WOMEN&#39;S LOT IN SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ENGLAND (Wolfson Award for History, 1984), THE WARRIOR QUEENS: BOADICEA&#39;S CHARIOT, THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII, MARIE ANTOINETTE: THE JOURNEY (Franco-British Literary Prize 2001), which was made into a film by Sofia Coppola in 2006 and most recently LOVE AND LOUIS XIV: THE WOMEN IN THE LIFE OF THE SUN KING. She was awarded the Norton Medlicott Medal by the Historical Association in 2000. Antonia Fraser was made DBE in 2011 for her services to literature. Her most recent book is MUST YOU GO?, celebrating her life with Harold Pinter, who died on Christmas Eve 2008. She lives in London.

Written with Barnard's cooperation and with input from dozens of associates, drivers and rivals, this biography tells the entire story, both personal and professional, of a British design genius. Barnard's technical achievements are explored in detail--and in accessible language--with special emphasis on his brilliant initiatives while at McLaren (the first carbon-fiber composite chassis) and Ferrari (the first semi-automatic gearbox). <i>The Perfect Car</i> is also a human-interest story, telling a tale of innovation under intense pressure while Barnard endeavoured to maintain a stable family life. This is a landmark book that will be relished by anyone interested in motorsport and design.</p><p><p><br>Nick Skeens started writing about creativity for the Design Council with publications on subjects ranging from design education to creative thinking.

Thomas Jefferson recommended Benjamin Banneker for the job. Banneker was a free black man who lived at a time when black Americans had few, if any, rights. Yet he was an accomplished farmer, mathematician, astronomer, and surveyor. What Are You Figuring Now? is the story of a man who was never afraid to try something new, no matter how difficult.</p></p><p><p>JERI CHASE FERRIS is the award-winning author of twelve biographies for children and young adults, published by Lerner Books and HoughtonMifflin/Harcourt. She specializes in biographies of people from 1776 to 1936 who overcame difficulties or discrimination or worse, to do great and important deeds for America. Many of her books are about multicultural heroes who, until recently, have been sadly omitted from history. Others are about important people you may not know, yet. For example - Noah Webster! NOAH WEBSTER &amp; HIS WORDS, Houghton Mifflin Books for Children, is an SCBWI Golden Kite Award winner for best nonfiction book of 2012. Her books have won lots of other awards too (see www.jerichaseferris.com).<br><br>Jeri retired from a happy 30-year teaching career several years ago in order to write full time. As a history major, Jeri loves the research process (easier than actually writing!) and she travels all over the world to research and collect information on her subjects. She is currently completing a historical fiction for young adults set in Leningrad, USSR (now St. Petersburg, Russia) during the 900-day Siege in WWII. This book, SURROUNDED: THE NAZI NOOSE, comes from her passion for Russia and its history, culture, and people, and her desire to convey the unimaginable experiences of the people and youth of 1941 Leningrad to American young people and adults.&nbsp;<br><br>When she's not writing or traveling or researching or reading, Jeri is probably riding her big sorrel rescue horse Pamyat ("to remember" in Russian), or dancing, or acting, or singing, or playing with her Scottie dog Nasha ("ours" in Russian). Or she might be studying Russian (one of these days she'll get it), or working on her blog or her newspaper column. Speaking of riding, when Jeri was demonstrating her horseback riding skills at the Nebraska State Fair some years ago, she fell off her horse and broke her arm in front of the whole crowd. (One of these days she'll get it.)</p>Grade 2-4 Banneker, born of free black parents near Baltimore in 1731, is remembered for his skill as an astronomer, mathematician, and surveyor. He worked with Andrew Ellicott, the surveyor appointed by George Washington, to lay out the boundaries of Washington, D.C. A great deal of information and a long period of time have been compressed and simplified in an attempt to make Banneker's life and contributions accessible to young readers. Dialogue has been added, most likely for the same reason, although it is sometimes jarring. For example, when Benjamin begins the Quaker school, his grandmother's musing portends the boy's future: " 'Benjie,' she said, 'I wonder what great things you're going to do some day. And I wonder how you can do them on a tobacco farm.' " Little information is given on the restrictive laws of 18th-Century America which would help place Banneker in an appropriate context. No sources are cited with the exception of an acknowledgement to Silvio Bedini, the author of a definitive adult biography entitled The Life of Benjamin Banneker (Landmark, 1984). Bedini and others are noted for further reading in Lillie Patterson's biography for children, Benjamin Banneker: Genius of Early America (Abingdon, 1978; o.p.). Maria B.

Now Angie and her quilting circle must stitch together clues before they&#x2019;re the ones running for cover...<br>&nbsp;<br><b>INCLUDES QUILTING TIPS!</b></p><p><b>Isabella Alan</b> is the national bestselling author of the Amish Quilt Shop Mysteries, including <i>Murder, Handcrafted</i>; <i>Murder, Plainly Read</i>; <i>Murder, Served Simply</i>; <i>Murder, Simply Stitched</i>; and <i>Murder, Plain and Simple</i>.

Through the closed door, I heard the cheerful Pennsylvania Dutch chatter of the ladies from my quilting circle. Normally, the sound would have made me smile. Today, any noise was certain to cause an instant migraine.</p><p>I dabbed my face with a damp paper towel, careful not to mar my eye makeup. When Ryan Dickinson showed up at my door, I wanted to look my best. Not for him but for me. Didn&#x2019;t every girl feel like that when confronted with her ex-fianc�? Of course, most girls don&#x2019;t have their parents to blame for the reunion. I rested my forehead on the mirror and willed myself to get a grip.</p><p>A tap came at the door. &#x201c;Angie, are you okay in there?&#x201d; asked Anna, who had been my aunt Eleanor&#x2019;s closest friend.</p><p>I opened the door. My kitten, Dodger, and French bulldog, Oliver, sat on either side of her. Concern was plastered on all three of their faces.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; I said, forcing some Christmas cheer into my voice.</p><p>None of them bought my act.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Ya</i>,<i> </i>you sound like it.&#x201d;</p><p>If you had asked me before my move from Dallas to Ohio&#x2019;s Amish Country whether Amish women were sarcastic, I would have said no. Boy, did Anna prove me wrong.</p><p>&#x201c;I <i>am</i> fine.&#x201d;</p><p>She stepped back to give me enough space to exit the bathroom.</p><p>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t seem that way earlier today. When your parents and Ryan arrived, you practically threw them onto the progressive-dinner sleigh. You barely gave Mattie and me enough time to introduce ourselves.&#x201d;</p><p>I crossed the shop to the long table lined with tureens of soup, each made by a lady from my quilting circle, and chili made by me. I had to bring a little of Texas to this Christmas in Ohio. &#x201c;The sleigh was leaving,&#x201d; I said as I stirred my chili. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want them to miss this important event in Rolling Brook. It&#x2019;s not like they will have another chance to have an Amish progressive dinner.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They will if they come next Christmas,&#x201d; Anna said.</p><p>I shivered. &#x201c;Mom and Dad are welcome back, but this will be the <i>last</i> Christmas Ryan Dickinson spends in Rolling Brook if I can help it.&#x201d;</p><p>Mattie Miller, my young assistant in the shop, said, &#x201c;Ryan is very handsome.&#x201d;</p><p>I scowled at the chili. <i>Maybe I should add some more hot sauce and show them how we really do chili in Texas.</i></p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s no more handsome than the sheriff. The sheriff is distinguished,&#x201d; Anna said.</p><p>I flinched. There lay the heart of the problem. Ryan Dickinson, my ex-fianc�, and Sheriff James Mitchell, my kind-of boyfriend, were together in the same county for Christmas. I never thought I would see the day, not even in my worst nightmares. And it was all thanks to my mother, the mastermind behind the drama.</p><p>Suddenly, the chili didn&#x2019;t seem all that appetizing. I debated going back to the bathroom in case I needed to toss the half dozen Christmas cookies I had pilfered from the tray Mattie had brought across the street from her family&#x2019;s bakery. I placed the glass lid back on the Crock-Pot.</p><p>Mattie&#x2019;s thin eyebrows wrinkled. &#x201c;Angie, you don&#x2019;t look so good. Are you ill?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be fine. The holidays are always stressful, right?&#x201d;</p><p>Anna sniffed. &#x201c;The <i>Englisch</i> make it stressful. It&#x2019;s not that way in the Amish world. We know Christmas is a time of reflection on our faith, and to be with family.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think most English folks know that too,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But there are also credit cards involved.&#x201d;</p><p>Anna shook her head as if I&#x2019;d hit her with yet another mysterious English riddle.</p><p>Mattie unwrapped a third stack of plastic bowls from their packaging and set them on the edge of the table. &#x201c;The progressive dinner is across the street at the bakery.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Already?&#x201d; I swallowed hard. The next stop would be Running Stitch. I hurried to the front window. Sure enough, the progressive-dinner sleigh was off-loading customers, most of whom were local English folks, with the exception of Ryan and my parents.</p><p>Before the cold could seep through their heavy winter coats and parkas, they dashed into the bakery. My best friend and Mattie&#x2019;s sister-in-law, Rachel Miller, would warm them up with hot coffee and some of her prizewinning friendship bread.</p><p><i>Maybe if Mom and Ryan overeat, they will be too ill to talk to me about whatever brought them to Ohio this Christmas,</i> I thought, feeling more cheerful. Then I could spend the rest of the week avoiding talking to them about it. I wouldn&#x2019;t mind talking with my dad though. I suspected he was on my side. Plus, Dad had the ability to pack away a couple of pies single-handedly. The progressive dinner wouldn&#x2019;t even be a challenge for him.</p><p>Mattie patted my arm as she carried a tray of crackers to the second long table along the quilt shop&#x2019;s front window. &#x201c;Angie, don&#x2019;t worry so much. It will all be fine.&#x201d;</p><p>When had Mattie become the calm, reassuring one? When she&#x2019;d started working for me four months ago, she&#x2019;d been a quiet, unassuming Amish girl. I liked the new Mattie, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure how her conservative brother felt about her new confidence.</p><p>I peered out through Running Stitch&#x2019;s display window. One of my favorite quilts, a double wedding ring pattern done in Christmas red and green, hung over the quilt stand next to a five-foot Christmas tree decorated with white lights and pincushions as ornaments. The Amish don&#x2019;t have Christmas trees in their homes. Like everything else, their Christmas decorations are modest&#x2014;some greenery and maybe a string of popcorn at most. I shuddered at what my Amish friends would think of the nine-foot glitzed-and-glittered tree that sat in the front hall of my parents&#x2019; home back in Dallas. There were enough electric bulbs on it to light up an aircraft carrier. Dad always said it wasn&#x2019;t worth putting up a Christmas tree unless you could see it from space. Thinking of the tree made me nostalgic and happy that both of my parents were in Rolling Brook for Christmas.</p><p>The sleigh shifted forward a foot as the two draft horses shuffled in place. Steam escaped from their nostrils as they stamped the snow-covered road. Jonah, Anna&#x2019;s son and my childhood friend, sat on the driver&#x2019;s seat of the sleigh. He spied me in the window and waved. He arched his sandy-colored eyebrows as if to ask a question. <i>Great,</i> I thought, <i>even Jonah wonders how I&#x2019;m going to handle Ryan. Does the entire town know my ex-fianc� is here for Christmas?</i> I already knew the answer to that one.</p><p>Behind me, Anna and Mattie spoke in hushed tones. I walked across the room in time to hear Mattie say, &#x201c;Aaron said it&#x2019;s wrong for the <i>Englischers</i> to portray the Amish that way.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Ahh,</i> I thought, <i>the play. An Amish Christmas</i> was the second hot topic in town, and I was happy to have it. At least it took some of the heat off me.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you hear what it&#x2019;s about?&#x201d; Mattie asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Judging from the title,&#x201d; Anna said, &#x201c;something about the Amish and Christmas.&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Nee.&#x201d;</i> Mattie put her hands on her hips. &#x201c;I mean yes, but it&#x2019;s mostly about an Amish girl who falls in love with an <i>Englischer</i> and leaves the community. My brother says that it belittles our way of life.&#x201d;</p><p>Anna snorted. &#x201c;Let the <i>Englisch</i> have their fun.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If it were just <i>Englischers</i>.&#x201d; Mattie lowered her voice until I could barely hear her. &#x201c;Eve Shetler is in the play.&#x201d;</p><p>Anna clicked her tongue. &#x201c;<i>Ya,</i> I heard that. Eve is an <i>Englischer</i> now. It&#x2019;s not our concern what she does now that she has left the community.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Many don&#x2019;t feel that way. It&#x2019;s fine she left the community, but why would she come back and mock it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think the play is meant to mock anything,&#x201d; I said, jumping in for the first time.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you seen it?&#x201d; Mattie asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No, I heard bits and pieces when I was at the inn setting up for the Christmas quilt show. Tonight will be the first time I&#x2019;ll see it run all the way through.&#x201d; The progressive dinner would end at the Swiss Valley Hotel on Rolling Brook&#x2019;s border with Berlin. The grand finale of the evening would be the opening of <i>An Amish Christmas</i>. Perhaps now was not the best time to mention the musical numbers in the production.</p><p>Mattie smoothed the pile of napkins on the table. &#x201c;Then you can&#x2019;t say for sure.&#x201d;</p><p>I opened my mouth to protest, but the bell over the front door rang. Progressive diners poured into the quilt shop. Cheerful chatter quickly filled the small shop. The women raved over the quilts, and the men made a beeline for the tureens of soup. Anna and Mattie took up their posts behind the soup table and began dishing hot soup and chili into bowls.</p><p>Mom, Dad, and Ryan were in the back of the pack. My father gave me a huge grin, and it took all my willpower not to run over to him and give him a big bear hug like I had when I was a little girl. The man behind him, Ryan, stopped me. Ryan had a pained expression on his face as he rubbed his arms, as if to get blood circulating. Clearly, spending the night freezing in an Amish sleigh as it moved from business to business in Rolling Brook and eating heavy Amish food were not what he expected when he arrived in Ohio. I knew Ryan, the fitness fanatic, was already calculating the number of calories he&#x2019;d consumed since his plane landed and how many hours it would take in the gym to burn them off.</p><p>His gaze zeroed in on me. Could I be wrong, but did his expression soften? My stomach did a little flip. I wouldn&#x2019;t let Ryan&#x2019;s chocolate puppy-dog eyes work their magic on me. I wasn&#x2019;t going to be fooled this time. Never again.</p><p>I broke eye contact, and I took a deep breath. It was just a week. What could possibly happen to ruin Christmas in a week?</p><p>I glanced down at my beloved Frenchie, Oliver. He covered his nose with his white paw. Oliver knew better. He knew all the players on and off the stage.</p></p><h2>Tilting the Balance (Worldwar, Book Two)</h2><p><b>While Stalin, Churchill, Roosevelt, and Togo worked out their strategy, the war against an even greater enemy continued . . .&nbsp;</b><br><br>They cut the United States in two.<br>They devastated much of Europe.<br>They had a ferocious agenda.<br>And no one could stop them.<br><br>World War II screeched to a halt as the Russians, Germans, Americans, and Japanese scrambled to meet an even deadlier foe.<br><br>In Warsaw, Jews welcomed the invaders as liberators, only to be cruelly disillusioned.

The menace worsens in this, the second novel in the four-book alternate-history saga that <i>Booklist</i> called "possibly the most ambitious in the subgenre's history and definitely the work of one of alternate history's authentic modern masters."What got me about the Worldwar series wasn't the aliens. It wasn't the warfare (though Harry's really good at it--I especially love the tanks). It wasn't even the fact that he'd turned history on its ear in a big way. No, it was the people. <br><br>If they were historical figures, like Josef Stalin, or Adolf Hitler, or Omar Bradley, he really brought them back to life. But even they took a back seat to Harry's original characters--the soldiers, the civilians, the resistance members, the spies. Whether they were American or Russian or British or Chinese, he made me care about them, about their lives and their loves. And he made me care a lot about their deaths--the kind of deaths that happen in war.<br><br>He made the most out of cultural juxtaposition, when a Polish Jew had to fight alongside a Nazi, or a British officer found himself in a tumultuous affair with a female Russian pilot (and sharpshooter--whoosh).

A trip to a charming seaside inn with his dog Towser is meant to raise his sagging spirits. Instead, he arrives at "Friendly House" to find the ambiance chilling, the food inedible, and his fellow guests less than neighborly. There's an amorous spinster, two tarty girls, a retired military man, a secretive London family, and Bob Harris, who so nags his wife, Doris, that everyone wants to kill him. Then somebody does. Soon Macbeth is called upon to act -- to dig into the past and deep into the heart to deliver something more daunting than merely the culprit: Justice.</p><p>M. C. Beaton has won international acclaim for her New York Times bestselling Hamish Macbeth mysteries. The BBC has aired 24 episodes based on the series. Beaton is also the author of the bestselling Agatha Raisin series, which will air as an eight-episode dramatic series on Sky1, starring Ashley Jensen. She lives in the Cotswolds with her husband. For more information, you can visit MCBeaton.com.After a romantic disappointment and an undeserved demotion, Scots village bobby Hamish MacBeth, seen last in Death of a Charming Man, decides a week's holiday at the coastal village of Skag might be just the ticket. He's dead wrong, of course: the food is dire, and the man in the next room nags his wife so loudly and continuously that more than one person at the The Friendly House bed-and-breakfast wishes him dead, though only Hamish is heard threatening him. When this chap's body is found floating in the river Skag, Hamish is the prime suspect. While clearing his name, the lanky Scot has to deal with the widow, who's suddenly making eyes at a refined bachelor; two leather-skirted Glaswegian beauties intent on raising disco hell; and the rude revelation of one family man's secret life. Some holiday. Beaton has fine-tuned her MacBeth series into something altogether winning. In this 11th entry, her plot is top-notch, a few somber notes demonstrate her touch for understated compassion and, as always, Hamish and his highland cohorts are lovingly rendered. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring</h2><p>Naruto was a young shinobi with an incorrigible knack for mischief. Then he channeled that energy into learning amazing ninja techniques and saving the world! Now Naruto has achieved his dream to become the greatest ninja in the village and his face sits atop the Hokage monument. But new troubles are bubbling up in the shinobi world...<br> <br>With the world now safe and the ninja villages working together, Naruto's work as Hokage seems pretty mundane. Giving his son, Boruto, enough attention is the toughest task he has. But then Sasuke uncovers a conspiracy that may involve surviving members of the Uchiha clan. And at the same time, Sarada is begins to have doubts about the truth of her origins.</p><p>Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural Okayama Prefecture, Japan. Like many kids, he was first inspired to become a manga artist in elementary school when he read <i>Dragon Ball</i>. After spending time in art college, he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his story <i>Karakuri</i>. After considering various genres for his next project, Kishimoto decided on a story steeped in traditional Japanese culture. His first version of <i>Naruto</i>, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; his final version, which debuted in <i>Weekly Shonen Jump</i> in 1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in the world. The series would also spawn multiple anime series, movies, novels, video games and more. Having concluded the series in late 2014, Masashi Kishimoto has kept himself busy this year with the side story <i>Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring</i> and writing the story for the latest <i>Naruto</i> movie, <i>Boruto: Naruto the Movie</i>, both of which will focus on the title character's son, Boruto.Gr 6 Up-This stand-alone set in the "Naruto" universe focuses on an 11-year-old girl named Sarada who sets off on a quest to find more information about her father. She and her friend Cho-Cho go into the forest, where they find Lord Seventh (Naruto, the greatest ninja in the village). He rescues them from an attacker and then brings them to a tower where Sarada's father, Sasuke, has been staying. At times the plot moves quickly, with lots of action, fights, and magical ninja attacks. There are many clones and characters with ocular powers and a character who is kidnapped through teleportation. But sometimes, between the action scenes, the story slows down to focus on Sarada and the drama unfolding in her life. There are multiple flashbacks here, both Sarada thinking back to her childhood and Naruto thinking back to his own youth as he tries to connect to her search for her real parents. The artwork is filled with energy, from the dramatic close-ups of characters' faces during emotional scenes to blurs of motion during the fight scenes. This book would be most appreciated by fans of the "Naruto" universe, because they will understand the background of the characters and will enjoy the flashbacks to the earlier books in the series.

Dorothy Mills had an uncanny and unique ability to write history that is interesting and at the same time based on sound scholarship. Her direct, engaging approach is valued increasingly by the many parents in our day who are looking for reliable materials for homeschooling or home study, as well as by many private school educators.<p> Angelico Press has undertaken to reprint the highly-prized six volumes of her historical works as part of its effort to offer texts ideally suited to the needs of a new generation of teachers and students.

Te Ata, born Mary Frances Thompson, earned international acclaim for employing her talents as a performer in the interpretations of traditional stories, many of them given to her by her father, and many collected from other Native tribes and traditions. She used her performances, and the recognition they brought her, to build lasting bridges of cultural understanding and acceptance. Her name became known throughout the United States, and her performances and interests compelled her to become a veteran world traveler. Author Richard Green also touches on the private side of Te Ata&#39;s life, including the intrigue of her early relationship with Clyde Fisher, the man who would become her beloved husband and benefactor. This new collector&#39;s edition includes additional photos from her family&#39;s private collection, many never before published.</p><p>Richard Green has served since 1994 as a tribal historian for the Chickasaw Nation. He also was founding editor of the Journal of Chickasaw History and Culture. He has published several articles concerning his research into the history and stories of the people of the Nation, some of which are found in the four-volume Chickasaw Lives series published by Chickasaw Press from 2007 to 2012.

CLASSIC ARMS AND MILITARIA An important and welcome book. I cannot imagine that there will be a better book published in English on this subject for a long time. PAUL MORTIMER, WITHOWINDE Undoubtedly destined to become a standard reference for blade fanciers and re-enactors. MEDIEVAL HISTORY A splendid book which gives a comprehensive overview of (these) swords. I find little to fault in Peirce&#39;s work other than that I wish it were three times the length. RUNA A book with a clear audience in mind: anyone who wants to study a magnificent set of Viking artefacts. SPECULUM An important reference work for scholars as well as for weapons enthusiasts.

The book contains detailed instructions and checklists for many of the activities a new agent must master, such as building a contact database, learning the market, working with buyers, crafting marketing listings, and negotiating inspections. Allan also shares many stories from her own career that will help the new agent better understand her recommendations. Sell with Soul also speaks out against the status quo and asks agents to consider the needs of their clients before considering their own personal need for a paycheck, and counsels agents to welcome every learning experience, even when it does not result in a closed sale. Many new agents have told Allan how her book gave them hope that they could succeed without sacrificing their principles or changing their personalities.</p><p>Jennifer Allan is a former top producing real estate broker, a published author, a speaker, and a trainer. From her first day on the job as a real estate agent, she resisted the efforts of her company trainers, her broker, and her fellow agents to persuade her to implement the traditional real estate prospecting techniques of cold calling, door knocking, and mass mailing. Instead, she focused her business-building efforts on the people she already knew or the people she met. Without ever pestering a soul, she built a business based almost entirely on business and referrals generated from her sphere of influence. Jennifer has is a regular columnist in Realty Times and a frequent contributor to RIS Media, a member of the RE/MAX Hall of Fame, and is one of the industry&#39;s most popular bloggers."I am reading every real estate related book I can get my hands on, including big names like Ferry and Keller, and by far, have found your wonderful little book the most useful, helpful and entertaining. It is packed with information that is not taught in the real estate course and that is invaluable to a new agent. I can't say enough good things about your book. I admire your professionalism, your heart and ethical conduct; you are the agent I aspire to be once I am in the business." Jamie Carlson, SK Canada --Reader Review<br><br>"You are my hero! I loved your book. It was extremely well-written: conversational and informative without being preachy or condescending. Your message is like a session with a patient mentor."

He is currently the publishing director at Century in London.The Sacred History 1<p></p> Softly Falls the Dew&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<p></p> <br>In the beginning there was no time, no space, no matter&#x2014;only darkness.<br> <br>Scientists have almost nothing to say about this time&#x2014;and neither do mystics. Whichever way you look at it, it&#x2019;s almost impossible to discover anything at all about this darkness or even to find any words to begin to describe it.<br> <br>But while scientists claim it was nothing more than nothingness, believers claim it was nothing less than the teeming mind of God.<br> <br>It is from this point of disagreement, on an issue about which both sides should admit that they know almost nothing at all, that great epoch-making arguments have flowed&#x2014;the inquisitions, the persecutions, the imprisoning, the torture, the executions, the wars that continue into modern times.1<br> <br>One thing we all know for certain, whichever side we are on, is that in order to get to where we stand today, there must have been a transition from a state of no matter to a state in which matter began. Scientists have offered theories to explain this very mysterious transition, such as the &#x201c;steady state&#x201d; theory that says that matter is coming into existence all the time, that it is steadily precipitated out of the darkness. Then, of course, there is the Big Bang theory. This says that matter and space and time all sprang into being at once, bursting out of a single dimensionless, timeless point called &#x201c;the singularity.&#x201d; But whether it happened steadily or in one quick splurge, that is to say whatever the speed of the process, if you had been there with two physical eyes and been able to look at these events through the most powerful microscope, you would have seen very fine, at first almost abstract subatomic particles evolve and take shape as atoms. The cosmos was becoming suffused with stuff in the form of a very thin mist.<br> <br>You might have been reminded of the wonder you felt as a child when you woke at dawn and went out into the garden to find that dew had precipitated out of thin air. Even though it looked as if it hadn&#x2019;t rained overnight, the early rays of the sun revealed a lawn sparkling with drops of water. In Jewish mystical tradition the mystic dew of creation is sometimes thought of as softly falling from God&#x2019;s great shaggy mane.2<br> <br>Or you might have been reminded of the wonder you felt in the chemistry lab when among the Bunsen burners and racks of test tubes you first saw beautifully shaped crystals forming in a solution, as if ideas from another dimension were squeezing into our material dimension. And if you are a believer, that is exactly what did happen&#x2014;and that other dimension, the one that lends shape and form to our material dimension, is nothing less than the mind of God.<br> <br>In the visions of the mystics, the process of creation began when God began to think&#x2014;when thoughts began to emanate from the mind of God, wave after wave of them. And in the same way that wave after wave dashing upon the shore smooths the pebbles on the beach, so wave after wave coming out of the mind of God fashioned the first matter.<br> <br>Look at this mystic version of events more closely, look with imagination, and you can see that these waves of thoughts are actually made up of millions of angels. The first wave is made up of gigantic angels who fill the whole cosmos. Next comes a wave of lesser angels which the greatest angels have helped to create, and together these generate a third wave of smaller angels. This sequence flows down until we finally reach minute spiritual beings. They work to weave together what we recognize as the material world around us, the rocks and stones and trees.3<br> <br>Equating the thoughts of God with angels may seem odd. These days we tend to have a lowly conception of our own thoughts, seeing them as abstract things which hardly exist at all. But there is an older, perhaps more illuminating way of looking at thoughts that comes from the great religions. This sees thoughts as living beings, with a level of independent existence and a life of their own as we send them off into the world to do our bidding.</p><h2>Hermanas: Deepening Our Identity and Growing Our Influence</h2><p><strong>God calls Latinas to lives of influence.</strong> He created his Latina daughters to partner with him, live into the incredible plans he has for each of us, and walk in his grace and strength to help change this world. But many of us have heard cultural messages that make us doubt our adequacy. We have not seen many Latina women in positions of leadership, and we need more mentors and role models. Natalia Kohn, Noemi Vega Qui�ones, and Kristy Garza Robinson share their own journeys as Latinas and leaders. They find mentorship in twelve inspirational women of the Bible including Esther, Rahab, Mary, and Lydia, who navigated challenges of brokenness and suffering, being bicultural, and crossing borders. As we deepen our spiritual and ethnic identities, we grow in intimacy with God and others and become better equipped to influence others for the kingdom. The insights here will help any who seek to empower Latinas in leadership. You are not alone on this journey. Join your sisters and partner with our heavenly Father as you become the Latina leader God has called you to be.</p><p>Natalia Kohn Rivera is special projects coordinator for InterVarsity's LaFe ministry and campus staff in southern California and also serves on staff at the Pasadena International House of Prayer, where she trains people in prayer and worship and leads teams on trips to the Middle East.

She previously worked in campus ministry with Cru's Destino and InterVarsity's LaFe."Noemi, Kristy, and Natalia&#x2015;<em>mujeres poderosas</em>&#x2015;have woven together a beautiful tapestry of brave women in the Bible with their own leadership, faith, and identity journeys as Latinas in their book <em>Hermanas</em>. They do it without ignoring or compromising the important ethical, social, and spiritual concerns affecting Latinas today. They are profoundly honest with their own stories, not for the purpose of being overly sentimental but to illuminate the faithfulness of a loving God who fills his people with audacity, long-suffering, loyalty, wisdom, and partnership. As God was at work in the lives of hermanas like Ruth, Mary, Deborah, Esther, Rahab, and Hannah to fulfill his purposes, his unchanging nature continues to breathe vision, hope, and resiliency in Latina hermanas today. If you want to gain biblical insight from strong women in the Bible, grow in your understanding of the Latina experience in America, and thrive as a courageous leader, this book certainly will help you get there." (Orlando Crespo, national director of InterVarsity Latino Fellowship, author of Being Latino in Christ: Finding Wholeness in Your Ethnic Identity)<br><br>"<em>Hermanas</em> is a beautiful story tapestry told from the perspective of Latina Christ-followers. As a Latina who loves Christ, I was immediately drawn to this book that weaves Scripture into the faith journeys of the authors. I cannot wait to share this book with my friends!" (Ava Steaffens, chief executive officer, Christian Community Development Association)<br><br>"The book <em>Hermanas</em> provides words to feelings and unjust experiences that have been normative to our sisters in Christ for many years. The authors take us on a journey through the power of story with a blend of rich theology and encapsulate the struggle and the beauty of being a Latina in Christ." (Noel Castellanos, president, Christian Community Development Association)<br><br>"In this exceptional, creative reflection on the Scriptures, <em>Hermanas</em> gives us as readers a more intimate and accurate look at these women in Scripture. Our theology is shaped by our social and cultural location which makes it a gift to have these exceptional teachers bring solid biblical exegesis with a nuanced cultural hermeneutic. They invite us to journey with these sisters in Scripture as they understood their identity and utilized their influence to make an impact. It is a gift to anyone teaching and preaching from the Scriptures to have this in their theological library." (Sandra Maria Van Opstal, author of The Next Worship)<br><br>"<em>Hermanas</em> is a precious and beautiful resource for discipleship. The young Latinas I have mentored need the nourishing, affirming, strengthening, and inspiration that this book offers. I recommend it de todo corazon." (Alexia Salvatierra, affiliate professor, Centro Latino, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"<em>Hermanas</em> is enjoyable reading because it is informative about the biblical texts presented. The authors explore issues of identity in very fresh ways that go beyond essentialist constructions of identity, and they use Scripture for the purposes of mentoring. What an excellent way to be guided by the Spirit&#x2015;it is modeled for us in these writings. This book is provocative reading that will edify your life, and it is a welcomed addition to Latina Evangelica writing. I highly recommend it." (Elizabeth Conde-Frazier, coordinator of relations, Theological Institutions for the Association for Hispanic Theological Education)<br><br>"The church has long ignored, if not silenced, voices of the likes of Rivera, Robinson, and Vega Qui�ones and suffered for it. Clear out time and space to read this book as the authors generously unpack their personal stories and Scripture with wisdom, insight, and a much-needed challenge and invitation to consider how Christ-filled leadership impacts individuals <em>and</em> their communities." (Kathy Khang, speaker, author of Raise Your Voice)<br><br>"A soul-nourishing and timely balm to the many social identity and faith crises in our country today! I am so grateful for the wisdom and thoughtfulness these three uniquely different but equally social justice driven and Jesus-committed women of <em>Hermanas</em> bring to the table. As a Latina faith leader, I am overjoyed to have such a wonderful resource in my repertoire! If you are struggling with understanding the intersections of social identity, womanhood, and faith in general, or if you are struggling with your own chingona-ness and faith, you are in good hands." (Alma L. Zaragoza-Petty, cohost of The Red Couch Podcast, writer, speaker, educator, and mentor)<br><br>"By embracing their identity as Latinas and Evang�licas, the authors explore their own stories in light of the stories of key biblical women, in a warm but powerful way. The result is a rich tapestry where love, courage, truth, wisdom, affirmation, and sisterhood are weaved together in order to invite Latinas, and the general reader as well, to be brave and strong as they journey through life and serve as leaders. This book is a much-welcomed addition to the emerging Christian literature from a Latina Evang�lica perspective." (Nora O. Lozano, professor of theological studies, Baptist University of the Am�ricas, executive director, Christian Latina Leadership Institute in San Antonio, Texas)<br><br>"Gracias hermanas for this powerful and much-needed contribution! Reading the stories of women in the Bible through a fresh lens which reflects the richness and multiplicity of the lived experience of Latina women gives these well-known stories a unique hue and depth by which to connect with Scripture, God, and one another. In echoing with the Latina experience, this collaborative book brings intergenerational voices alongside one another to share their stories as one. Latina women will find here rich treasures by which to become part of the story as they reflect on their own personal leadership journeys and ask themselves: Where is the Holy Spirit guiding me to be of influence and impact for God's purposes in my community?

Instead of living in poverty like St. Francis of Assisi, she lived most of her life in a castle surrounded by incredible wealth. She was born Princess Elizabeth of Hungary, the daughter of King Andrew. By the age of four she was already engaged to be married and was sent far away from her home to live with Louis, her husband-to-be, who was only 10 years old. From the beginning of her life in her new castle, Elizabeth was ridiculed by all of those people who were jealous of her. They noticed that she was always trying to be holy. As she would play games with other children, she would contrive little ways to sneak into the chapel and have a visit with Jesus.</p><p>Although Elizabeth was a princess, she longed to live the kind of poverty she heard about through the Franciscans. She became a member of the Third Order of St. Francis and she constantly gave her jewels and best clothes to the poor. Sometimes she gave everything away and had nothing nice to wear, but Jesus always provided for her at the last minute. When she emptied the castle store-houses of grain for the poor, Jesus would miraculously fill them up again. Her subjects were never able to grow accustomed to the queen who lived the life of a saint, but they always appreciated her generosity and saw in her such simplicity and holiness. Only four years after her death she was canonized a saint.</p></p><p></p><h2>Candle Walk: A Bedtime Prayer to God</h2><p><b>Share the beauty of nature and bedtime prayer with a child</b> <p>In this bedtime book, join in a candlelit wander through the woods, listening attentively to the river, trees, stars, and moths singing verses from scripture.

It deals with the history and definition of chaplaincy as well as the chaplain's call to ministry and relationship to his church. Specific challenges within the framework of chaplain ministry such as pluralism, prayer, and proselytizing are also addressed. MINISTRY OF PRESENCE would easily fit in the library of those already in the chaplaincy, chaplain candidates who are preparing for ministry, or anyone who is interested in learning about chaplaincy.&nbsp;The principles presented are not simply theory but have been born out of the context of Whit's experience and practicing what he preaches. His insights will encourage and challenge anyone seeking to minister from a biblical perspective in any venue of chaplaincy.</p><p></p><h2>Where Only Love Can Go: 30 Days With a Great Spiritual Teacher</h2><p>Where Only Love Can Go explores the central mystery of who God is and offers readers an introduction to the tradition of contemplative prayer, assisting them to view God in a new way.

Richly illustrated, including paintings by Julian P. Hume (many painted specifically for this volume), it enables us to enjoy vicariously avian life unique to Hawai'i that&nbsp;exists no longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Extinct Birds of Hawai'i</i> also sends a powerful message: Although Hawai'i is well-known for its unique scenic beauty and its fascinating native flora, fauna, bird and marine life, it is also called the extinction capital of the world. The Islands' seventy-seven bird species and sub-species extinctions account for approximately fifteen percent of global bird extinctions during the last seven-hundred years. On some islands over eighty percent of the original land bird species are now extinct. <br>With the many agents of extinction still operating in the Islands' forests, Hawai'i's remaining native land birds are at a high risk of being lost forever. Many birdwatchers, nature lovers, and eco-tourists are unaware of the tremendous loss of species that has occurred in this remote archipelago. <i>Extinct Birds of Hawai'i</i> shows the bird life that has been lost and calls attention to the urgent need for preservation action.</p><p>EmptySelected as one of the best bird books of 2016:<br><br>Ian Paulsen<br>BIRDBOOKER REPORT <br><br>Hawai'i is the bird extinction capital of the world. A sobering new book by Michael Walther summarizes the natural history, field notes and observations, and provides new paintings of these lost species - 77 overall. One of these, the Kaua'i '&#x14c;'&#x14d; , was last heard in 1987. "Extinct Birds of Hawai'i" also includes Walther's personal searches for some of these birds, highlights the ongoing conservation problems that face Hawai'i's remaining native birds, and discusses the urgent actions that&nbsp;American Bird Conservancy &nbsp;and other conservation organizations are taking to save them.<br><br>George E.

Hume, along with historical art by Frederick W. Frohawk and Johannes G. Keulemans, make the loss all the more poignant.</p> <p>The book is well organized, with birds pictured by type -- crakes, crows, finches, honeycreepers, rails -- along with each one's description, measurements, geographic range, time of first and last observation, and notes by naturalists. It produces something of the nostalgia of leafing through dinosaur books as a child, except that most of these extinctions took place over the past few centuries, not</p> millions of years.<br><br>Hawaii's endemic birds had few predators until humans arrived. The book quotes naturalist H.W. Henshaw's 1902 observation of the oo, whose yellow wing feathers were coveted for helmets, capes and lei: <br><br>"When feeding ... and with their young, the calls of the o-o [sic] are almost incessant ... which has led to the easy destruction of the species. The poor bird has yet to learn that its appreciation of the joyousness of existence and its love for its mate and young can be expressed only at the cost of its very life."<br><br>In addition to colorful honeycreepers like the oo, the islands once had singing thrushes; these plain brown birds weren't hunted for their feathers, but perished from diseases transmitted by introduced mosquitoes and poultry as towns such as Lanai City grew, observed George C. Munro in 1944.<br><br>"When singing the head is always thrown well back, the throat full and free. ... Once heard its character will live in the memory for years," wrote William A. Bryan of the Molokai thrush in 1908. By 1944, Munro noted, it was gone.<br><br>Walther lists the factors decimating Hawaii's native birds: "Predation by introduced rats, mongoose and feral house cats; competition with non-native bird species; destruction of forests by introduced cattle, sheep, goats and pigs; collection of bird feathers for making feather capes ... mosquitoes spreading avian malaria ... shooting of rare species by museum collectors between 1890-1910; and non-native vegetation displacing native vegetation."<br><br>A concluding chapter focuses on our remaining birds, with photos by Walther, who worked with Hawaii native bird survey teams in the 1990s and now operates O'ahu Nature Tours. Twenty-four Hawaii bird species are on the federal endangered species list, and some "have less than 150 individuals remaining," he notes.<br><br>Perhaps the World Conservation Congress, to be held in Honolulu in September, will help us save what we've got so our children's children might see and hear these winged barometers of our forests' health.<br><br>Review by Mindy Pennybacker Honolulu Star-Advertiser July 10, 2016 <br><br>A well illustrated guide to these species.

Many others, which have become extinct in the past couple of centuries, have been drawn from life by early birders or can be studied as museum skins, their colors still vivid. There are photographs of the ones lost during the last century. <br><br>I was particularly struck by the photo of one of the last three Laysan apapane, singing while perched on a coral outcropping.<br><br>Before Captain Cook sailed up to Waimea on the Big Island, the Islands had already lost owls and petrels and geese, ducks and ibis and finches, an eagle, a harrier and a host of flightless crakes, plus some others, like the Kaua`i palmcreeper and the King Kong grosbeak..<br><br>Most of the big birds were long gone before Europeans arrived.

In fact, Michael Walther, President of Oahu Nature Tours, just published a beautiful book titled Extinct Birds of Hawaii, which catalogues all the birds. The book outlines the different extinctions&#x2013;pre-European contact and post&#x2013;and includes descriptions of the birds, notations from the journals of collectors and observers from the late 1700s to 1900s&#x2013;often, the last people to see these birds alive.<br> <p><br>&#x201c;I wanted to let more people know about the catastrophic loss of bird species in the Hawaiian Islands during the last 1,000 years and to help the few species that remain by hopefully increasing support and funding for them,&#x201d; says Walther. &#x201c;I started research for the book in December of 2014 and it was completed one year later, December 2015. The quotes are from old books about Hawaii&#x2019;s birds written between 1782-1960. The majority of the quotes are from books that were published between 1892-1903. During this time, several English bird collectors were actively seeking rare Hawaiian birds for museum specimens and in many cases their descriptions of the birds in life are all that we really know about these extinct species behavior and songs.&#x201d;<br>In the book, each bird is accompanied by a glossy color illustration by researcher Julian P. Hume.<br><br>I worked closely with Storrs Olson and Helen James at the SmithsonianInstitution on reconstructing the birds in the most accurate, scientific way," says Hume." I start by drawing the fossil remains andanatomically putting them together to get the correct shape. Once thecolor was agreed with Storrs and Helen, I then put them in a backgroundscene and reproduced them in a natural way and often doing behavioralthings such as nesting, feeding and having territorial disputes. Thiswas to show that the birds were once alive and doing natural things.Some of them were so bizarre that it was difficult to imagine how theymay have looked in life. In particular are the Moa nalos, the giantflightless ducks with tooth-like projections on their jaws. I used myimagination based on the numerous visits to Hawaiian forests to recreate them in a natural setting."<br><br>Walther's book talks a lot aboutextinction, but the final chapter is saved for the extant birds-thosefew survivors-and what we can do about them. He mentions the work ofMaui Forest Bird Recovery Project and other similar groups in Hawaiiworking to save the remaining birds we have left.<br><br>Jen Russo<br><br>Maui Time</p><br><br><p>Most of Hawai&#x2018;i&#x2019;s endemic birds are endangered, some critically, as are many other animals and plants there. Before human settlement, the islands&#x2019; life forms had become almost freakishly abundant and diverse&#x2014;&#x201c;endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful,&#x201d; as Darwin described evolution&#x2019;s workings. Then humans arrived, and kept arriving, and their actions, both intentional and accidental, have reduced the biota to a fraction of its original extent. People bring complications, and their presence creates a tangle of ecological, political, economic, cultural, and philosophical challenges to the survival of endangered species. Much has been lost, and much more will probably be lost in the coming years.</p> <p>Extinction as a phenomenon has been stubbornly ignored for most of the last 150 years. The British scientist Alfred Newton noted in an 1892 letter to R.C.L. Perkins, the legendary Hawaii-based bird and insect collector, &#x201c;I know from experience that the belief in the continued existence of an extinct species dies very hard&#x2014;people can&#x2019;t understand why things cease to exist and therefore think that they go on.&#x201d; To a degree, his words remain true today: People still have a difficult time accepting that birds can go extinct. More insidiously, we have had a difficult time understanding why it would matter in our own lives. Part of the equation is our lack of understanding of the species at risk: what they are, what their roles have been in nature&#x2019;s tangled skein, and what is lost when they are gone.</p> <p>Michael Walther and the illustrator Julian Hume&#x2019;s concise but compulsively readable account, a welcome addition to the literature on Hawaiian birds, goes a long way to rectifying this lack of understanding. Its premise is simple: to list every known extinct bird from Hawai&#x2018;i, from species known only as fossils to those only relatively recently extinct. The book is modeled somewhat on Walther and Hume&#x2019;s 2012 Extinct Birds, a text-heavy (and physically heavy!) summation of every known extinct bird. The Hawaiian work itemizes a total of 77 species and subspecies, and is leavened by wonderful color illustrations by Hume and by many images drawn from classic works on Hawaiian birds: Scott B. Wilson and Arthur H. Evans&#x2019;s Aves Hawaiienses, issued in eight parts between 1890 and 1899 and illustrated by Frederick Frohawk; and Walter Rothschild&#x2019;s Avifauna of Laysan, issued in three parts between 1893 and 1900, illustrated by Frohawk and John G. Keulemans. The latter covers not just the birds of tiny Laysan Island, far up the northwestern chain of Hawaiian islands, but the avifauna of the main seven islands as well.</p> <p>Each entry in Walther and Hume&#x2019;s new book contains a detailed physical description of the bird, a statement of its historic or prehistoric range if known, and&#x2014;very usefully&#x2014;a tally of the specimens in museum collections. This last bit of information conceals some very labor-intensive efforts undertaken over the years by a number of people; it is not a trivial task to identify the surviving examples of birds housed in study collections around the world. Tracking down specimens means scouring collections databases, calling and e-mailing collections managers around the world, and taking other measures to ensure an accurate count. The front matter here is also extremely useful, including a brilliantly organized summary by island of land bird extinctions in Hawaii.</p> <p>Each entry also includes such historical information as when the first and last specimens were recorded by westerners, and finally, a Reports and Observations section. This last element takes up the bulk of each entry, and often makes for engrossing reading. It focuses on the habits and life histories of the birds where known, quoting at length from such well-known sources as Wilson and Evans, as well as accounts by ornithologists like William Bryan, George Munro, and R.C.L. Perkins.</p> <p>One important bird worker in Hawai&#x2019;i shows up too infrequently here: Henry Henshaw, a discerning observer of extinction on the islands and uncommonly interested in the habits of the living bird. As Henshaw&#x2014;a New Englander who had come to the islands for his health&#x2014;remarked to a friend in 1899, &#x201c;The Island birds interest me increasingly. They interest me both as specimens and in relation to their habits.&#x201d; Henshaw&#x2019;s extremely useful and detailed Birds of the Hawaiian Islands first appeared in Thrum&#x2019;s Hawaiian Almanac and Annual in 1901, and was published as an independent monograph the following year.</p> <p>This was information on the Hawaiian avifauna brought up to date for the early twentieth century, including considerable material not in Wilson&#x2019;s Aves Hawaiienses, which had mentioned other well-known Hawaiian collectors such as Munro, Palmer and R.C.L. Perkins with fulsome praise but said not a word about Henshaw&#x2019;s contributions. Henshaw&#x2019;s Birds was everything Wilson&#x2019;s beautiful book was not: unillustrated, modestly printed, and filled with contemporary discussions of the challenges facing Hawaiian birds. The front matter was full of new contributions, including a section on threats to the islands&#x2019; avifauna, among them environmental changes, habitat destruction, and the disease we now know as avian pox.

The topics discussed in the book introduce the participants to the basics of many important areas of modern mathematics, including logic, symmetry, probability theory, knot theory, cryptography, fractals, and number theory. Each chapter in the first part of this book consists of two parts. It starts with generously illustrated sets of problems and hands-on activities. This part is addressed to young readers who can try to solve problems on their own or to discuss them with adults. The second part of each chapter is addressed to teachers and parents. It includes comments on the topics of the lesson, relates those topics to discussions in other chapters, and describes the actual reaction of math circle participants to the proposed activities. The supplementary problems that were discussed at workshops of Math Circle at Kansas State University are given in the second part of the book. The book is richly illustrated, which makes it attractive to its young audience. In the interest of fostering a greater awareness and appreciation of mathematics and its connections to other disciplines and everyday life, MSRI and the AMS are publishing books in the Mathematical Circles Library series as a service to young people, their parents and teachers, and the mathematics profession.

Structured around the &#x201c;big five&#x201d; core topics of an effective reading program&#x2015;phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension&#x2015;the book explains tried-and-true teaching strategies for fostering all students' achievement. Key topics include engaging diverse students in classroom discussion, involving families in learning, and assessing and teaching new literacies. Numerous classroom examples demonstrate a wide range of easy-to-implement lesson ideas and activities for students at different grade levels, including struggling learners. Issues specific to English language learners are woven throughout the chapters.<p> &nbsp;</p><br></p><p><p> &nbsp;</p> Ellen McIntyre, EdD, is Professor and Department Head of Elementary Education at North Carolina State University. Dr. McIntyre conducts research and has published widely on teacher education, literacy instruction and student achievement, and the sociocultural factors that affect teaching and learning. Prior to her university work, she was a first-, second-, and sixth-grade teacher in an urban elementary school in Kentucky that served students of poverty. Her work has focused on classroom instruction and family involvement for students from populations who have historically struggled in school. &nbsp; Nancy Hulan, MEd, is a PhD candidate in Curriculum and Instruction (Literacy Focus) at the University of Louisville. She has taught diverse populations of students as a Reading Resource teacher, a Title I teacher, and a second-grade teacher in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Las Vegas. Ms. Hulan's research interests include student discussion patterns in the elementary classroom, instruction for linguistically and culturally diverse students, and teachers' decision-making processes concerning literacy instruction. &nbsp;&nbsp; Vicky Layne, MAT, is the Literacy Coach at Engelhard Elementary School in Louisville, Kentucky. Ms. Layne has taught all elementary grade levels and has implemented culturally responsive instruction with diverse populations of students from kindergarten through fifth grade.<p> &nbsp;</p>"Reader friendly, informative, and practical. This book is an ideal text for elementary literacy methods courses, but will be equally useful for practicing elementary teachers who strive to promote literacy achievement for all children. Chapters build on research in specific areas of assessment and instruction, drawing explicit, realistic connections to culturally responsive teaching. Teachers gain an understanding of how to take children's richly diverse backgrounds and experiences into account in implementing an effective literacy program."--Julie K. Kidd, EdD, College of Education and Human Development, George Mason University <p>"This book provides an important window into research-based strategies for how to teach reading in diverse classrooms. It also offers some viable solutions for what teachers can do to be successful. If we do the work this book challenges us to do, we will move closer to leveling the playing field for children of color in our nation's classrooms. It will surely become a seminal book on culturally responsive teaching."--Patricia A. Edwards, PhD, Department of Teacher Education, Michigan State University; President, International Reading Association (2010-2011)<br>&nbsp;<br>"McIntyre et al. present the latest thinking on ways to deliver culturally relevant literacy instruction that is both powerful and engaging. Perhaps the greatest assets of the book are its focus on dialogic instruction and its practical voice: the authors have created a vision of effective classroom teaching that aligns with current realities. This book is a 'must read' for teachers looking for a strong professional development resource. It is also a great foundational text for undergraduate reading methods courses. At a time when teacher education is flooded with outmoded reading methods textbooks, McIntyre and her colleagues offer us a fresh resource that promises to rise quickly to the top of the field."--Robert B. Cooter, Jr., EdD, Professor and Ursuline Endowed Chair of Teacher Education, Bellarmine University<br>&nbsp;<br>"This excellent book is needed now more than ever as we embrace rapidly changing demographics in our classrooms. The authors offer best practices that are grounded in research and theory and that reach beyond the National Reading Panel&#x2019;s five literacy pillars. Classroom teachers, literacy coaches, and students in teacher training programs need to read this book and keep it handy for reference during the school year."--Deborah A. Wooten, PhD, Department of Theory and Practice in Teacher Education, University of Tennessee</p><br><br>"This book is a valuable resource for classroom teachers and teacher candidates....The strategies and materials presented in the book are comprehensive and applicable to classroom teaching."<i></i>, <i>Educational Review</i> Published On: 2011-11-25</p><h2>Programming Perl: Unmatched power for text processing and scripting</h2><p><p>Adopted as the undisputed Perl bible soon after the first edition appeared in 1991, <i>Programming Perl</i> is still the go-to guide for this highly practical language.

This book shows you how you use this system to transform your own organization.</p></p><p>Seattle, WA, USA<p>If you work in the health and medical care field and you believe you and your institution are as good as it is possible to be, you should read this book. It will reset your standards and show you how to produce more value for your patients at a lower cost. This is a front line story, not a pie in the sky theory or project of the month. It is a story about real people dedicated to the pursuit of habitual excellence. <br>&#x2015;Paul O&#x2019;Neill, 72nd Secretary of the U.S. Treasury &amp;&nbsp;former Chairman and CEO of Alcoa </p> <p>A comprehensive and insightful book that chronicles an arduous journey to achieve an exceptional patient-centered culture using a management system only now recognized as relevant to health care. This is a story of how Virginia Mason became the benchmark against which other health care systems must judge themselves, and a beacon in a field that has resisted change for far too long. <br>&#x2015;David M. Lawrence, MD, MPH, Chairman and CEO (retired), Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Hospitals, Inc. <br><br>The challenges to our U.S. health care system have never been greater. We are challenged by the high cost of care and less than optimal quality and safety. Virginia Mason Medical Center has been on a ten year journey to demonstrate just what is possible and the results have been profound. What is equally amazing, and must reading for health care leaders, is the story of their journey. It is possible to improve quality and safety while simultaneously reducing cost! <br>&#x2015;John Kitzhaber, MD, Governor of Oregon 1995-2003 <br><br>U.S. health care is replete with stories of failed attempts to improve quality and control soaring costs, only to succumb to perverse incentives, infighting and an entrenched status quo. Virginia Mason offers a different path forward, by showing what happens when all of health care&#x2019;s stakeholders &#x2015; doctors, employers, insurers &#x2015; align themselves behind pursuing the best care for the patient. It&#x2019;s a potential model precisely because its leadership medical staff had to overcome the same challenges that affect hospitals and clinicians across the country today. <br>&#x2015;Vanessa Fuhrmans<strong>,</strong> <em>The Wall Street Journal <br></em><br>Congratulations to the Virginia Mason team for being another great example of committing to a compelling vision and to continuous quality improvement ... .

This book richly describes this process at Virginia Mason &#x2015; not just the principles but all the challenges along the way and how they were overcome. It is a textured account of an ongoing journey and as such is an invaluable aid to anyone serious about transforming their own organization. <br>&#x2015;Richard Bohmer, MBChB, MPH Professor of Management Practice, Harvard Business School <br><br>This is the story of a journey. It&#x2019;s a journey that began almost a decade ago, that continues today, and that will likely continue for the foreseeable future. Through a number of powerful case studies, this book illustrates how Virginia Mason Medical Center has steadily improved the safety, quality, and efficiency of its patient care &#x2015; one process at a time. But more importantly, it is a study in leadership and cultural transformation in one of our nation&#x2019;s most important industries &#x2015; health care. That transformation has made patient-centered care much more than a slogan at Virginia Mason; it has become a way of doing business, each and every day. The beneficiaries of that transformation, first and foremost, are the patients Virginia Mason serves. But of equal importance is the new-found sense of accomplishment and satisfaction that these changes have engendered among the Medical Center&#x2019;s physicians, management team and employees. This book is inspiring must reading for anyone who leads, or aspires to lead, any health care organization. <br>&#x2015; William F.

This book is the foundational element of understanding what it takes to really change a moribund culture. <br>&#x2015;John J. Nance, author, <em>Why Hospitals Should Fly <br><br></em>Virginia Mason Medical Center is widely recognized as the pioneer in applying the disciplines of the Toyota Production Systems to improve the delivery of health care. Now, with the publication of <strong>Transforming Health Care</strong>, we have a first-hand account of what they did and what they learned: the steps they took to make the concept of Team Medicine a reality; the struggles and successes in moving from physician-centric to patient-centered care; and the projects they have undertaken to redesign clinical pathways to eliminate waste and error, reduce scientific uncertainty, and promote patient preferences. An easy read, but also an in-depth account of Virginia Mason&#x2019;s effort to transform itself.

The entire historical timeline of African Americans is addressed, from the Colonial period through the civil rights upheavals of the late 1950s to 1961, the time of publication. "<em>Before the Mayflower"</em> grew out of a series of articles Bennett published in Ebony magazine regarding "the trials and triumphs of a group of Americans whose roots in the American soil are deeper than the roots of the Puritans who arrived on the celebrated <em>Mayflower</em> a year after a 'Dutch man of war' deposited twenty Negroes at Jamestown." Bennett's history is infused with a desire to set the record straight about black contributions to the Americas and about the powerful Africans of antiquity. While not a fresh history, it provides a solid synthesis of current historical research and a lively writing style that makes it accessible and engaging reading.</p><p>After discussing the contributions of Africans to the ancient world, "<em>Before the Mayflower"</em> tells the history of "the other Americans," how they came to America, and what happened to them when they got here.

But a poisoned apple hadn't propelled this girl to her final resting place, surrounded by love and remorse. Instead, she had been thrown away on the marble pedestal, discarded like so much trash. Her naked body arched around the center pole. The smaller flags circled her protectively, snapping with every gust of wind. Her left leg sprawled wildly, blocking one of the recessed lights tastefully highlighting the scene. <br><br>On closer inspection, a gaping knife wound was clearly visible, slashing merrily across the woman's neck. In the darkness, it smirked and shone deep burgundy, nearly black in places, with bright hunks of cartilage and bone showing through the wound. <br><br>Taylor arched an eyebrow at the mess. Oh, the joys of being the homicide lieutenant. She shivered in the gloaming, pulled her arms tight to her sides and rocked slightly. She was dressed for the weather&#x2014;a thigh-length shearling jacket over a cream cable-knit sweater and jeans, mittens and a scarf, but the cold seeped in through minuscule cracks, making her own blood sluggish. The air smelled of snow, sharp and bitter. The temperature had been hovering well below the freezing mark for several days, and the atmosphere was dense, portending a storm for Nashville. Winter's coming this week, people said. Taylor scuffed a cowboy boot in the frozen grass. <br><br>Waiting. She was tired of waiting. It seemed she spent her whole life in some form of suspension, glancing at her watch, knowing it would only take a few minutes, a few hours, a few days for something or another, for someone. <br><br>The M.E. would be on the scene soon. All she had to do was wait. <br><br>It was too chilly to stand still any longer. Taylor stretched her arms to the sky, felt a kink release below her right shoulder blade. Too tense, and the freezing temperature didn't help. She wandered into the night, happy to let the stench of death leave her sinuses, only to draw back in pain as the reek was replaced by mind-searing cold. Her eyes teared. Giving a brief glance back over her shoulder, she paced the granite wall bordering the amphitheater. Distanced a bit, she turned, taking in the entire scene. <br><br>She had to admit, Nashville's Bicentennial Mall was a lovely setting for murder. Opened in 1996 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Tennessee's statehood, it had never reached the pinnacle of success the city leaders had hoped for. It was still a charming walking mall, a favorite for outdoor lunches and the odd midday jogger. A very quiet area at night, too. The only crowd that had gathered to mark this murder was a multitude of blue-and-white patrol cars, still flashing at attention. That would change as soon as the media got wind of the scene. And the condition of the victim. Most likely, this was victim number four. <br><br>"Damn." <br><br>The national news vans would continue to line the streets of downtown Nashville, waiting for any police misstep that would give them another day in the news cycle. Two months of constant media attention had everyone's nerves frayed. Three families were torn apart&#x2014; make that four, once they had an ID on this new girl. More sleepless nights than Taylor could count. <em>Keep moving. It's going to break soon. </em><br><br>The south edge of the mall, where the dead girl lay prostrate, was a tribute to the Tennessee State Flag. Eighteen flags, eight encircling one taller, delimited each side of a granite walkway. They waved gaily, buffeted by the chilled breezes, unaffected by the gory scene in front of them. Perhaps that was fitting. Tennessee had earned its nickname&#x2014;The Volunteer State&#x2014;for the multitudes of men who joined in the fight during the Civil War. LeRoy Reeves of the Third Regiment, Tennessee Infantry, had designed the flag. The crimson fabric, overlaid with three white stars, highlighted the blood and bone inert at the base of the flagpole. <br><br>It was a beautiful scene, if you liked postcards from hell. The fourth such tableau since the Snow White Killer had materialized from under his goddamned rock and started killing again. <br><br>Taylor looked past the flagpoles, past the body. Bordered by an ornate concrete railroad trestle, the view rose directly up a well-manicured, lighted hill, atop which perched the state Capitol, its neoclassic lines glowing majestically in the darkness. The heart of downtown stretched beyond the building. Her town. Her responsibility. Taylor turned away, continued her walk. <br><br>Their killer wasn't being subtle, the setting was designed to capture their attention. Two blocks from Channel 5 and four from police headquarters. There were traffic circles on either side of the mall, an easy way to slip in, throw out a body and continue right on out to James Robertson Parkway. Taylor was shocked the local CBS affiliate wasn't already on the scene. <br><br>A flake of snow drifted in front of her eyes, its fragile crystalline beauty entrancing. How something so beautiful could wreak such havoc&#x2014;the weather was turning for the worse. The forecast called for at least a foot in the low-lying areas around Metro, up to fifteen inches on the plateau. Midstate gridlock. <br><br>To top it all off, in a little less than one hundred twenty hours, five short days, Taylor was due at St. George's. For her wedding. <br><br>Taylor took a deep breath and walked back to the body.<br><br>She pulled up a sleeve and glanced at her watch. The M.E. should have been here by now. She was good and ready to have this body moved. To get out of the cold. To get some rest before the big day. To do whatever needed to be done to assure that the event would go on as planned. A little voice niggled in the back of her mind. <em>It wouldn't be the end of the world if we needed to push it back. How the hell are we supposed to get married and go on a honey</em><em>moon in the middle of a major murder case? </em><br><br>A media satellite truck slipped by on the main street, silent as a shark. Taylor figured they were angling for a full shot of the scene, coming around the back of the mall on James Robertson Parkway, slinking up to Charlotte and Sixth. Shit. Time to move. <br><br>Shivering in the cold, she reached into her coat pocket for her cell phone. As she flipped it open, a white van with discreet lettering pulled into the klieg lights. The M.E. Finally. <br><br>Taylor snapped the phone closed and strode across the grass, heedless of the groomed path she was supposed to follow. She fairly leapt to the side of the van, motioning for the driver to put the window down. The medical examiner, Dr. Samantha Loughley, complied, and Taylor shoved her face into the warm interior. Bliss. <br><br>"Taylor, get out of the way." Sam put her hand under Taylor's chin and nudged her face back out the window. She slammed the gearshift into Park and stepped from the van. Clothed for the weather in a black North Face fleece jacket, Thinsulate-lined duck boots and pink fur earmuffs, she nodded brusquely. <br><br>"Okay, where is she?" <br><br>"On the flagpole pedestal. You really should take a minute before you start, walk down the mall and look back up here. It's quite pretty." Taylor smiled. <br><br>"You're a ghoul. Any idea who she might be?" <br><br>"No. She's naked, no sign of any purse or clothing. Do you think it's going to snow as much as they said?" <br><br>"I heard we might get twelve inches. Or more." Sam winked at Taylor and started for the body. Taylor followed her, questioning. Visions of airport closures, snowplows running into ditches, caterers with no electricity ran through her mind like drunken mice. She shouldn't be so happy at the thought of her wedding being postponed. <em>Good luck with that, Taylor. Even if it snowed ten feet, in five days people would manage to get it in gear. </em><br><br>"They're never accurate, though. Seriously, weathermen are notorious for getting the forecast wrong. Right? Sam?" <em>Maybe the snow would hold off until Thursday.... </em><br><br>The M.E. wasn't listening anymore. She'd just caught her first glimpse of the body. She went rigid, stopped in her tracks. <br><br>Taylor put a hand on her best friend's shoulder, all personal worries pushed away for the time being. <br><br>"I know," she murmured, squeezing Sam's shoulder. "It looks that way to me, too. Meet Janesicle Doe." <br><br>"Wow. Certainly appears to be his work." Sam knelt by the body, staring intently at the dead girl's face. <br><br>"He's changing it up. This isn't a separate dump site&#x2014; judging by the amount of blood, I'd bet my badge she was killed right here." <br><br>"And not that long ago, either." Sam reached for her bag. Taylor knew what came next and stepped away to let Sam do her work. <br><br>The lights of the sneaky satellite truck snapped on with an audible hum, catching Taylor in the gleam. She excused herself, went to block the cameras. The media was getting bolder with each killing, Taylor had no intention of letting them ruin her case with suppositions. <br><br>Behind her, she heard Sam whisper, "Bingo."<br><br><em>Nashville, Tennessee <br>Monday, December 15 <br>9:24 p.m. </em><br><br>Taylor fidgeted under the hot studio lights of the Fox affiliate in Nashville. Their parent network, Fox News, wanted to get the lowdown on the Snow White case from the inside, and Taylor had been ponied up for the slaughter. As soon as she'd been set and miked, the remote anchor had been drawn into a breaking-news story: a suicide bomber had taken out a group of diners at a restaurant in Jerusalem, claiming the lives of fifteen and injuring two Americans. The news alert had been going on for a while, giving her plenty of time to second-guess agreeing to be interviewed. <br><br>She was grateful for the opportunity to get the word out, though she would have preferred the newspeople talk with Dan Franklin, Metro's official spokesman. She wasn't fond of doing on-air interviews. Understandably, the reemergence of the Snow White Killer had the entire country up in arms, not to mention her own city and her homicide division. That meant everyone was pulling cross duties. <br><br>She wiped her fingers across her forehead, gathering little beads of sweat. It would be nice if they turned off the lights while she waited. She stared blindly into the bowels of the studio, her mind in overdrive. The network had specifically requested Taylor's presence. She suspected it had more to do with her notorious background than the fact that she was the lead investigator on a sensational series of crimes. The anchor had been warned to steer clear of the Win Jackson story, and Taylor hoped they would listen for once. <br><br>Oh, Win. Where in the world are you? <br><br>There was a commotion. The tech was signaling they were going live. He counted down, then went silent, showing his fingers. Three, two, one. She took a deep breath, blew it out slowly and smiled for the camera. <br><br>"We're back now with Homicide Detective Lieutenant Taylor Jackson from the Metro Nashville Police Department. We're talking about the horrific string of murders plaguing Music City, a town more accustomed to the shenanigans of country music stars than murderers. Just last night, a new victim of this dreadful killer was found. <br><br>"Lieutenant Jackson, have you identified the body of this latest victim?" <br><br>"No, we haven't. We&#x2014;" <br><br>"And this is victim number four, correct?" <br><br>"It's too soon to&#x2014;" <br><br>"Two months ago, police found the battered body of young kidnap victim Elizabeth Shaw. The girl had been raped and her throat cut with a sharp object presumed to be a military-style knife. Three weeks later, the body of Candace Brooks was discovered, the cause of death identical. Last week, a young woman named Glenna Wells was found near Percy Priest Lake, raped, beaten and showing signs of exsanguination due to a knife slash across her throat. The crime scenes showed eerie symmetry, and the Nashville police are investigating what seems to be a serial murderer."<br><br></p><h2>The Cows (Quarternote Chapbook Series)</h2><p><p>"You read Lydia Davis to watch a writer patiently divide the space between epiphany and actual human beings by first halves, then quarters, then eighths, and then sixteenths, into infinity," says <i>The Village Voice</i>.

The piece, written with understated humor and empathy, is a series of detailed observations of the cows on different days and in different positions, moods, and times of the day. It could be compared to some sections of Wallace Stevens' "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird" or to Claude Monet's paintings of Rouen Cathedral.</p><p><i>Forms of play: head butting; mounting, either at the back or at the front; trotting away by yourself; trotting together; going off bucking and prancing by yourself; resting your head and chest on the ground until they notice and trot toward you; circling each other; taking the position for head-butting and then not doing it.</i></p><p><i>She moos toward the wooded hills behind her, and the sound comes back.

Featuring an overview of the state&#x2019;s geologic history as well as a site-by-site guide to the best rockhounding locations, Rockhounding Wisconsin is the ideal resource for rockhounds of all ages and experience levels.</p><p>Robert Beard is a geologist and has collected rocks for over 30 years. In his early days of rock collecting, fellow geologists said that he would get over the excitement from finding an interesting rock, but that never happened. He majored in geology at California State University, Chico and his first rock collecting trips focused on the northern Sierra Nevada and southern California desert. He received his B.A. in geology, with a minor in mathematics from CSUC in 1983. He then attended the University of New Mexico as a graduate student in geology, and spent considerable time looking for rocks in New Mexico's mountains and deserts. He worked briefly for a mining company as part of an exploration team during his first summer in New Mexico, and got to see many different types of mineral deposits and geologic terrains, and developed a keen understanding minerals and how to find them. He received his M.S. degree in geology from UNM in 1987, at a time when the mining and oil industries were flat on their backs, but the environmental cleanup industry was just getting started. In 1988 he moved to the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania area to pursue a career as an environmental geologist. Since then he has remained alert for opportunities to see geology and collect rocks, minerals, and fossils, as he was taught that the best geologist is the one that has the most rocks. He has collected rocks throughout most regions of the United States and parts of the Caribbean, and the past few years he was focused on finding new collecting sites in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. He is a Contributing Editor to Rock &amp; Gem magazine, and has written from Rock &amp; Gem since 1993. He also speaks Spanish, which has been a very useful skill for geology, especially when working in Spanish-speaking environments. He currently lives in Harrisburg, PA with his wife, Rosalina, and his two children, Daniel and Roberta.</p><h2>Mission Between the Times: Essays on the Kingdom</h2><p><p>Ren� Padilla is one of the premier representatives of orthodox evangelicalism in Latin America.

It landed in a field of brown dirt and withered weeds.<br> <br>Suddenly the field began to glow and glimmer. Rows of golden wheat sprang up next to rows of green, leafy vegetables and trees bearing figs and apples.<br> <br>Six other Olympians, who were all her same age, stood behind her and watched with wide eyes. They had seen Demeter do this before, but it was still amazing every time.<br> <br>Blond, blue-eyed Apollo strummed on his lyre, singing:<br> <br>&#x201c;A field that once was brown and lean<br> <br>Is now so healthy and so green!&#x201d;<br> <br>Hestia&#x2019;s brown eyes sparkled, and she clapped her hands together. &#x201c;Demeter, it&#x2019;s beautiful!&#x201d;<br> <br>Demeter smiled, pleased, and blushed a little.<br> <br>Behind them the residents of the small village began to clap and cheer. Young children ran into the field, staring at the plants in wonder.<br> <br>The village elder, a small, gray-haired woman, approached the Olympian god&#x2019;s young leader, Zeus. She grabbed his hands in her strong grip.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said, her pale eyes glistening with tears of joy. &#x201c;We have suffered greatly since that horrible Titan Hyperion burned our fields so we could not grow crops. But you have brought us rain and water, and now this. For the first time in many days, I feel hopeful that we will survive. You are our hero.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zeus grinned. &#x201c;Well, it wasn&#x2019;t just me. It was all of us working together.&#x201d; He nodded toward the other Olympians. &#x201c;And now Demeter&#x2019;s Magic Seeds are growing new crops.&#x201d;<br> <br>Poseidon stepped over to Zeus and slung an arm around his shoulders. He waved the long-handled, three-pronged golden trident he&#x2019;d gotten when he&#x2019;d discovered he was god of the sea. &#x201c;And my boltbrain bro and I combined our powers to whip up a nice rainy storm to fill your wells. &#x2018;Zap! Bam! Sizzle!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who are you calling &#x2018;boltbrain,&#x2019; Fishlips?&#x201d; Zeus demanded with a grin.<br> <br>Laughing, Poseidon lunged toward him with the trident, mock-fighting. Zeus held up Bolt, the magical lightning bolt he carried.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bolt, large!&#x201d; Zeus commanded. Instantly it sprang from dagger-size to the size of Zeus. Zing! Zeus pretended to fend Poseidon off with it.<br> <br>Hera stepped up to them, her blue eyes snapping with annoyance as she flipped her long blond hair back over her shoulder. &#x201c;Those are magical objects, not toys,&#x201d; she scolded. Then she turned to Poseidon. &#x201c;And since when do you call Zeus &#x2018;bro&#x2019;?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Since I found out we were brothers, duh,&#x201d; Poseidon said, beginning to twirl his trident. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re almost like twins.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zeus and Poseidon did look alike, both with the same wavy hair, but Zeus&#x2019;s eyes were the color of the sky he commanded, and Poseidon&#x2019;s were turquoise, like the sea.<br> <br>Humpf. &#x201c;Well, you better not start calling me &#x2018;sis,&#x2019; &#x201d; Hera warned.<br> <br>Just two weeks before, six of the Olympians&#x2014;Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, Hades, Hestia, and Demeter&#x2014;had learned that they all had the same mother. Her name was Rhea and they hadn&#x2019;t seen her since they were born. Zeus had been raised away from the others by a nymph, a goat, and a bee. And suddenly discovering he had brothers and sisters had been a delicious feeling.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can call me &#x2018;bro&#x2019; all you want, Bro,&#x201d; Zeus told Poseidon.<br> <br>The village elder spread her arms wide and spoke again. &#x201c;We thank all of you! Please take anything you need for your journey from our fields. We have some bread and cheese we can give you too. Is there anything else you might need?&#x201d;<br> <br>Demeter looked down at her tunic, which was torn and stained after their recent encounter with a giant beanstalk. The other Olympians were looking pretty ragged too after weeks on the road.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, do you guys have any spare clothes?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>The woman nodded. &#x201c;Of course. I&#x2019;m sure we can find something for each of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Zeus said. &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;re all set, then. Clothes, food, and weapons.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zeus shaded his eyes against the sun. In the distance a flock of birds slowly flew in a circle. When the sun hit them, they sparkled. Weird. He had been seeing them for days. Those sparkly birds had him a little worried.<br> <br>At the word &#x201c;weapons&#x201d; some of the villagers came closer. &#x201c; &#x2018;Weapons&#x2019;? Why would you need weapons?&#x201d; asked one grizzled farmer.<br> <br>&#x201c;King Cronus doesn&#x2019;t exactly like the fact that we&#x2019;re going around fixing what his giant Titan buddies are messing up around the Earth,&#x201d; Zeus replied. &#x201c;His Crony soldiers are always after us, and then we usually end up running into monsters, and, well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we need weapons to fight them and protect ourselves. Some of us have magical objects that can be used in fights. But not all of us do.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hera folded her arms across her chest and glared at Zeus when he said this. She was one of the Olympians without a magical object. Apollo didn&#x2019;t have one either, but he didn&#x2019;t seem to mind, the way she did. At the moment he was happily strumming his lyre, singing a tune while some of the village children danced.<br> <br>The old man nodded. &#x201c;King Cronus is no friend to anyone here. He and his henchmen Cronies are always stomping on our fields and stealing whatever they like from us. Not to mention trying to take over the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hades stuck out one arm and pulled back his other, pretending to cock a bow and then shoot an arrow from it. &#x201c;Not if we can help it! If we run into those Cronies, I can put on my helmet, turn invisible, and shoot at our enemies with my bow and arrows. They&#x2019;ll never know what hit them!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s lucky we found those bows and arrows in that abandoned hunting cabin,&#x201d; Hera said, glaring at Zeus, &#x201c;seeing as not all of us are lucky enough to have magical objects of our own! Now at least all of us have weapons, even if they aren&#x2019;t magical.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Here is something you should know: I am excellent with a bow,&#x201d; Apollo said, using rhyme-speak, as he often did.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just hope we won&#x2019;t have to use them,&#x201d; Demeter added.<br> <br>The villagers scattered to gather cheese and bread while the Olympians happily filled the packs they were given with fruit and vegetables from the field. Before long they were back on the road to the town of Corinth, dressed in new tunics and carrying packs of food.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Poseidon complained, glancing at Apollo as they walked along, &#x201c;how come I didn&#x2019;t get the blue tunic, instead of this orange one? I&#x2019;m the ruler of the sea, after all. And blue is the color of the sea.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s true that you are ruler of the sea, but this blue tunic fits great on me,&#x201d; Apollo replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop complaining and just be glad that we haven&#x2019;t seen a sign of the Cronies in days,&#x201d; Hades said to Poseidon.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe we&#x2019;ve lost them,&#x201d; said Demeter.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be so sure,&#x201d; Hera said darkly. &#x201c;They always seem to turn up, no matter how hard we try to throw them off our trail.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But we&#x2019;re in the middle of nowhere,&#x201d; Poseidon said, looking around. The path to Corinth was taking them across a wide, mountainous area. They tried to stick to the foothills, but there were steep climbs along the trail. &#x201c;Why is Pythia sending us all the way to Lake Stymphalia to find a shield, anyway?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stymphalia&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#x201d; Apollo repeated. &#x201c;I swear I&#x2019;ve heard of that somewhere before. Stymphalia&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Stymphalia&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just any shield. It&#x2019;s an aegis,&#x201d; Zeus reminded Poseidon, pronouncing it &#x201c;EE-jiss.&#x201d; &#x201c;It must be super-special, or she wouldn&#x2019;t make us go to all this trouble to find it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It had better be,&#x201d; Apollo said, his usually bright eyes growing dark. &#x201c;I really wanted to go off on my own to find my twin sister, Artemis, but I promised Pythia we&#x2019;d all stick together.&#x201d;<br> <br>Pythia, the Oracle of Delphi, had been sending the Olympians on quests ever since they&#x2019;d gotten together. The guests had three goals: to find more Olympians; to gather magical objects; and finally, to defeat the evil King Cronus. When they last saw Pythia, she told them to win the aegis through battle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hera, are we still on course?&#x201d; Zeus asked.<br> <br>Hera looked at the stone amulet that hung around her neck. It was named Chip and belonged to Zeus. He&#x2019;d gotten it in Delphi when he&#x2019;d found Bolt, his magical object. He felt bad that Hera didn&#x2019;t have her own object yet, so he let her wear Chip, an oval-shaped smooth, gray stone.<br> <br>Chip was very useful. It could talk when it wanted to, in its own language (Chip Latin). Also, if you asked it a question, writing would appear to give you the answer. It even showed them maps sometimes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Which way to Lake Stymphalia, Chip?&#x201d; Hera asked. Instantly a glowing arrow appeared on the surface of the stone, pointing straight ahead. She grinned. &#x201c;Looks like we&#x2019;re good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you call being hungry and tired and stuck in an orange tunic &#x2018;good,&#x2019; then yes, we&#x2019;re good,&#x201d; Poseidon grumbled.<br> <br>They walked on for a while longer, crossing a desertlike plain with mountains rising all around. But as they got closer to Corinth, the land was greener, with thick forest all surrounding them. The ground under their feet was damp and muddy.<br> <br>Suddenly Hera stopped walking. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a strange track,&#x201d; she said, kneeling to stare at the ground. &#x201c;It looks like a human foot. But there&#x2019;s only one. See? And there&#x2019;s another track a few feet ahead.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A few feet? I thought you said it was one foot,&#x201d; Poseidon joked.</p><h2>When Animals Speak: Techniques for Bonding With Animal Companions</h2><p><b>The trusted guidebook for animal lovers that describes the astonishing ways in which humans can speak with&#x2014;and listen to&#x2014;all creatures.<br><br></b>In this comprehensive follow-up to the widely popular Animal Talk, a respected leader and pioneer in the field of interspecies communication, Penelope Smith, outlines advanced techniques for conversing with animals. She explains that since animals think and perceive differently from humans, readers need to have a true willingness to share, listen, and learn to successfully communicate with them. Although most humans assume that an animal functions on pure instinct, unaware of its own past or future, that&#x2019;s just not the case. Many subtle secrets about the world can be gleaned from animals once readers know how to see the world through their eyes. Cats, dogs, and other domesticated animals may be more receptive to communicating with humans, but they&#x2019;re certainly not the only ones with fascinating information to share&#x2014;Smith shows how humans are also able to speak with roosters, rabbits, insects, llamas, snakes, and many others in the animal kingdom. In addition to chapters devoted to developing and enhancing mind-to-mind communication with animals, When Animals Speak includes an illuminating look at animals as healers, teachers, and guides and even delves into more abstract, advanced forms of interspecies communication, such as contacting spirits of nature. In this accessible book, Smith is sure to delight and instruct animal lovers interested in forging a new bond with animal beings and the natural world.</p><p><b> <br>Penelope Smith </b>is the author of <i>Animals in Spirit </i>and <i>Animal Talk</i>.

For over a decade it has been out of print with only expensive used copies available; now it is available at an affordable price and in a more accessible format. <br><br><i>On First Principles</i> is the most important surviving text written by third-century Church father, Origen. Origen wrote in a time when fundamental doctrines had not yet been fully articulated by the Church, and contributed to the very formation of Christianity. Readers see Origen grappling with the mysteries of salvation and brainstorming how they can be understood. This edition presents G. W. Butterworth's trusted translation in a new, more readable format, retains the introduction by Henri de Lubac, and includes a new foreword by John C. Cavadini. As St. Gregory of Nazianzus, Doctor of the Church, wrote: "Origen is the stone on which all of us were sharpened."</p><p>Origen (ca. 184--ca. 253) is considered the most important biblical scholar and theologian of the early Greek Church, and some have even called him the finest scholar of the first millennium of Christianity. He fits into a legacy of prominent figures from the Alexandrian Church, which was under persecution during his time. His father was martyred when he was seventeen, and several of the students whom he converted to Christianity also went on to martyrdom. <br><br><i>On First Principles</i> was one of Origen's earliest and most significant writings. Another was his <i>Hexapla</i>, an enormous edition of the Old Testament arranged in six columns of Hebrew and Greek text. It is known as a colossal landmark in the study of Scripture. Many of his homilies were also recorded, and are widely read today.<br><br>Near the end of his life, Origen was tortured by civil authorities in an effort to make him apostatize. While they did not succeed, Origen died a confessor from related causes a few years later."Origen of Alexandria truly was a figure crucial to the whole development of Christian thought." --<b>Pope Benedict XVI</b><br>"Vatican II taught that scripture is the soul of theology. Few so fully embraced that conviction as did Origen. In this he remains an inspiration for all who see the vital connection among proclamation, catechesis, and theology. Thus it is good to have Origen's theological masterpiece, <i>On First Principles</i>, available again. As Henri de Lubac writes in his splendid introduction: 'It is the work of a good and brave man whose supreme desire was to know the truth.'" --<b>Rev.

Bush<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>Surge</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Years from now, historians may look back and see the surge as a forgone conclusion, an inevitable bridge between the years of violence that followed liberation and the democracy that emerged. Nothing about the surge felt inevitable at the time. Public opinion ran strongly against it. Congress tried to block it. The enemy fought relentlessly to break our will.<br>Yet thanks to the skill and courage of our troops, the new counterinsurgency strategy we adopted, the superb coordination between our civilian and military efforts, and the strong support we provided for Iraq&#x2019;s political leaders, a war widely written off as a failure has a chance to end in success. By the time I left office, the violence had declined dramatically. Economic and political activity had resumed. Al Qaeda had suffered a significant military and ideological defeat. In March 2010, Iraqis went to the polls again. In a headline unimaginable three years earlier, <i>Newsweek </i>ran a cover story titled &#x201c;Victory at Last: The Emergence of a Democratic Iraq.&#x201d;<br>Iraq still faces challenges, and no one can know with certainty what the fate of the country will be. But we do know this: Because the United States liberated Iraq and then refused to abandon it, the people of that country have a chance to be free. Having come this far, I hope America will continue to support Iraq&#x2019;s young democracy. If Iraqis request a continued troop presence, we should provide it. A free and peaceful Iraq is in our vital strategic interest. It can be a valuable ally at the heart of the Middle East, a source of stability in the region, and a beacon of hope to political reformers in its neighborhood and around the world. Like the democracies we helped build in Germany, Japan, and South Korea, a free Iraq will make us safer for generations to come.<br>I have often reflected on whether I should have ordered the surge earlier. For three years, our premise in Iraq was that political progress was the measure of success. The Iraqis hit all their milestones on time. It looked like our strategy was working. Only after the sectarian violence erupted in 2006 did it become clear that more security was needed before political progress could continue. After that, I moved forward with the surge in a way that unified our government. If I had acted sooner it could have created a rift that would have been exploited by war critics in Congress to cut off funding and prevent the surge from succeeding.<br>From the beginning of the war in Iraq, my conviction was that freedom is universal&#x2014;and democracy in the Middle East would make the region more peaceful. There were times when that seemed unlikely. But I never lost faith that it was true.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Financial Crisis</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Mr<b>. </b>President, we are witnessing a financial panic.&#x201d;<br>Those were troubling words coming from Ben Bernanke, the mild-mannered chairman of the Federal Reserve, who was seated across from me in the Roosevelt Room. Over the previous two weeks, the government had seized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two giant housing entities. Lehman Brothers had filed the largest bankruptcy in American history. Merrill Lynch had been sold under duress. The Fed had granted an $85 billion loan to save AIG. Now Wachovia and Washington Mutual were teetering on the brink of collapse.<br>With so much turbulence in financial institutions, credit markets had seized up. Consumers couldn&#x2019;t get loans for homes or cars. Small businesses couldn&#x2019;t borrow to finance their operations. The stock market had taken its steepest plunge since the first day of trading after 9/11.<br>As we sat beneath the oil painting of Teddy Roosevelt charging on horseback, we all knew America was facing its most dire economic challenge in decades.<br>I turned to the Rough Rider of my financial team, Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson, a natural leader with decades of experience in international finance.<br>&#x201c;The situation is extraordinarily serious,&#x201d; Hank said. <br>He and the team briefed me on three measures to stem the crisis. First, the Treasury would guarantee all $3.5 trillion in money market mutual funds, which were facing depositor runs. Second, the Fed would launch a program to unfreeze the market for commercial paper, a key source of financing for businesses across the country. Third, the Securities and Exchange Commission would issue a rule temporarily preventing the short-selling of financial stocks. <br>&#x201c;These are dramatic steps,&#x201d; Hank said, &#x201c;but America&#x2019;s financial system is at stake.&#x201d;<br>He outlined an even bolder proposal. &#x201c;We need broad authority to buy mortgage-backed securities,&#x201d; he said. Those complex financial assets had lost value when the housing bubble burst, imperiling the balance sheets of financial firms around the world. Hank recommended that we ask Congress for hundreds of billions to buy up these toxic assets and restore confidence in the banking system.<br>&#x201c;Is this the worst crisis since the Great Depression?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Ben replied. &#x201c;In terms of the financial system, we have not seen anything like this since the 1930s, and it could get worse.&#x201d;<br>His answer clarified the decision I faced: Did I want to be the president overseeing an economic calamity that could be worse than the Great Depression?<br>I was furious the situation had reached this point. A relatively small group of people&#x2014;many on Wall Street, some not&#x2014;had gambled that the housing market would keep booming forever. It didn&#x2019;t. In a normal environment, the free market would render its judgment and they could fail. I would have been happy to let them do so.<br>But this was not a normal environment. The market had ceased to function. And as Ben had explained, the consequences of inaction would be catastrophic. As unfair as it was to use the American people&#x2019;s money to prevent a collapse for which they weren&#x2019;t responsible, it would be even more unfair to do nothing and leave them to suffer the consequences.<br>&#x201c;Get to work,&#x201d; I said, approving Hank&#x2019;s plan in full. &#x201c;We are going to solve this.&#x201d;<br>I adjourned the meeting and walked across the hallway to the Oval Office. Josh Bolten, Counselor Ed Gillespie, and Dana Perino, my talented and effective press secretary, followed me in. Ben&#x2019;s historical comparison was still echoing in my mind.<br>&#x201c;If we&#x2019;re really looking at another Great Depression,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;you can be damn sure I&#x2019;m going to be Roosevelt, not Hoover.&#x201d;</p><h2>Nothing General About It: How Love (and Lithium) Saved Me On and Off General Hospital</h2><p><p><strong>The Emmy Award-winning star of <em>General Hospital</em> chronicles his astonishing and emotional life journey in this powerful memoir&#x2014;an inspiring story of success, show business, and family, and his struggle with mental illness.</strong><br><br>Maurice Benard has been blessed with family, fame, and a successful career. For twenty-five years, he has played one of the most well-known characters on daytime television: <em>General Hospital</em>&#x2019;s Michael &#x201c;Sonny&#x201d; Corinthos, Jr. In his life outside the screen, he is a loving husband and the father of four. But his path has not been without hardship. When he was only twenty, Maurice was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. </p><p>In <em>Nothing General About It</em>, Maurice looks back to his youth in a small town and his tenuous relationship with his father. He describes how his bipolar disorder began to surface in childhood, how he struggled to understand the jolting mood swings he experienced, and how a doctor finally saved his life. For years Maurice was relentless in his goal to be a successful actor. But even after he &#x201c;made it,&#x201d; he still grappled with terrifying lows, breakdowns, and setbacks, all while trying desperately to maintain his relationship with his wife, who endured his violent, unpredictable episodes. Maurice holds nothing back as he bravely talks about what it was like to be medicated and institutionalized, and of how he learned to manage his manic episodes while on the set of <em>GH. </em></p><p><em>Nothing General About It</em> is also an incredible love story about an enduring marriage that demonstrates what those vows&#x2014;for better, for worse, in sickness and in health&#x2014;truly mean.

Its notoriety is so great that its title has become a generic term for disaster, for ego run rampant, for epic mismanagement, for wanton extravagance. It was also the film that brought down one of Hollywood&#x2019;s major studios&#x2014;United Artists, the company founded in 1919 by Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, D. W. Griffith, and Charlie Chaplin. Steven Bach was senior vice president and head of worldwide production for United Artists at the time of the filming of <em>Heaven's Gate</em>, and apart from the director and producer, the only person to witness the film&#x2019;s evolution from beginning to end. Combining wit, extraordinary anecdotes, and historical perspective, he has produced a landmark book on Hollywood and its people, and in so doing, tells a story of human absurdity that would have made Chaplin proud.</p></p><p><p>Steven Bach has been associated with the motion pictures <em>Sleuth</em>, <em>The Parallax View</em>, <em>The Taking of Pelham One Two Three</em>, and <em>The French Lieutenant's Woman</em>, in addition to <em>Heaven's Gate</em>.

Harry Turtledove, renowned alt-historian and the editor of this anthology, calls that question "those two mournful little words." But little though they might be, they inspired some of the previous century's most brilliant speculative fiction, including the 14 short stories collected here.<p> And with contributors like Poul Anderson, Greg Bear, Gregory Benford, Larry Niven, Kim Stanley Robinson, Bruce Sterling, and Turtledove himself, there's truly not a clunker in the bunch. All of these stories revolve around Turtledove's central beard-tugging question, but they vary wildly in style, mood, and approach. Many toy with how the future might be altered had some particular event turned out differently (what if the Confederates had won at Gettysburg, or the <i>Enola Gay</i> had crashed before making its fateful flight?), while others follow dimension-hoppers traveling through tangled branches of our timeline (as in Sterling's "Mozart in Mirrorshades," Anderson's "Eutopia," and Jack L. Chalker's surreal ferry ride through "Dance Band on the <i>Titanic</i>").</p><p> All but four of these stories were written in the last two decades of the century--before then, Turtledove suggests in part, we weren't scientifically certain about whether Martians and "oceans on Venus full of reptilian monsters" might exist, so we were satisfied by more conventional, planet-faring SF. But the ideas that the contributors wrestle with here, and that irresistible human urge to speculate about the implications of our actions (and whether our decisions matter at all), prove timeless. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><b>Harry Turtledove</b> is the award-winning author of the alternate-history works <i>The Man with the Iron Heart, The Guns of the South, </i>and <i>How Few Remain</i> (winner of the Sidewise Award for Best Novel); the Hot War books: <i>Bombs Away, Fallout, </i>and<i> Armistice;</i> the War That Came Early novels: <i>Hitler&#x2019;s War, West and East, The Big Switch,</i> <i>Coup d&#x2019;Etat, Two Fronts, </i>and<i> Last Orders; </i>the Worldwar saga: <i>In the Balance, Tilting the Balance, Upsetting the Balance,</i> and<i> Striking the Balance;</i> the Colonization books: <i>Second Contact, Down to Earth,</i> and<i> Aftershocks; </i>the Great War epics: <i>American Front, Walk in Hell,</i> and <i>Breakthroughs;</i> the American Empire novels: <i>Blood and Iron, The Center Cannot Hold, </i>and <i>Victorious Opposition;</i> and the Settling Accounts series: <i>Return Engagement, Drive to the East, The Grapple, </i>and<i> In at the Death</i>.

Claims that Native peoples should be recognized as coeval with Euro-Americans, Rifkin argues, implicitly treat dominant non-native ideologies and institutions as the basis for defining time itself. How, though, can Native peoples be understood as dynamic and changing while also not assuming that they belong to a present inherently shared with non-natives? Drawing on physics, phenomenology, queer studies, and postcolonial theory, Rifkin develops the concept of "settler time" to address how Native peoples are both consigned to the past and inserted into the present in ways that normalize non-native histories, geographies, and expectations. Through analysis of various kinds of texts, including government documents, film, fiction, and autobiography, he explores how Native experiences of time exceed and defy such settler impositions. In underscoring the existence of multiple temporalities, Rifkin illustrates how time plays a crucial role in Indigenous peoples&#x2019; expressions of sovereignty and struggles for self-determination.</p><p>Mark Rifkin is Director of the Women's and Gender Studies Program and Professor of English at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro and the author of several books, including <i>Settler Common Sense: Queerness and Everyday Colonialism in the American Renaissance</i>."Rifkin offers the compelling argument that challenging normative settler time engenders new possibilities for Native articulations of futurity." (Stephanie Lumsden <i>Studies in American Indian Literatures</i> 2017-10-01)<br><br>"Rifkin&#x2019;s book presents a novel and ambitious perspective in analysing the process of land dispossession and forced assimilation of Native Americans during the consolidation of the U.S. national state in the nineteenth century and its afterlife." (Carolina Aguilera <i>Ethnic and Racial Studies</i> 2018-04-05)<br><br>"A theoretically robust and intellectually satisfying work that challenges readers to think differently not only about the past, but also about time. . . . A welcome addition to the robust body of interdisciplinary writing that has become renowned for its thick descriptions of space and place. . . . Rifkin&#x2019;s approach is innovative, his analysis is theoretically sophisticated, the scaffolding upon which his analysis hangs is inspiring, and the vocabulary he advances is both useful and empowering." (Kieth Thor Carlson <i>American Historical Review</i> 2018-10-30)<br><br>"A quite brilliant work of theory. . . ." (James Mackay <i>American Literary History</i> 2019-04-01)<br><br>"Rifkin&#x2019;s work moves us toward a more expansive understanding of the ways in which collective memory, ceremonial practices, prophesy, oral traditions, and place- based knowledges inform Indigenous corpo-realities and shape quotidian experiences of synchronously felt pasts, presents, and futures. This text is a critical addition to Native American studies and should be read by all striving for a decolonial future."<br> &nbsp; (Sarah Whitt <i>American Indian Quarterly</i> 2018-09-01)</p><h2>Zen Pencils-Volume Two: Dream the Impossible Dream (Volume 2)</h2><p>Cartoon quotes from inspirational folks!<br><br> "Than fuses inspirational quotes with his own comics panels and in the process creates something finer that simply the sum of the two.

Yet in <em>Words Without Music</em>, his critically acclaimed memoir, he creates an entirely new and unexpected voice, that of a born storyteller and an acutely insightful chronicler, whose behind-the-scenes recollections allow readers to experience those moments of creative fusion when life so magically merged with art. From his childhood in Baltimore to his student days in Chicago and at Juilliard, to his first journey to Paris and a life-changing trip to India, Glass movingly recalls his early mentors, while reconstructing the places that helped shape his creative consciousness. Whether describing working as an unlicensed plumber in gritty 1970s New York or composing <em>Satyagraha</em>, Glass breaks across genres and re-creates, here in words, the thrill that results from artistic creation. <em>Words Without Music</em> ultimately affirms the power of music to change the world.</p> 32 pages of photographs</p><p>Born in Baltimore in 1937, Philip Glass studied at the University of Chicago and the Juilliard School. The composer of operas, film scores, and symphonies, he performs regularly with the Philip Glass Ensemble and lives in New York.&#x201c;Illuminating...<em>[Glass] is always vigorous in defending his artistic choices and aesthetics. Glass's music may sound simple, but it revels in subtle complexity.</em>&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sudip Bose, <em>Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Glass, a key figure of musical minimalism, was one of the first composers to reject a distinction between 'ethnic' music and Western classical music, and in this memoir he explains how he came to view a composition not as a linear narrative but as progressive rhythmic sequences.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The New Yorker</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Essential reading for anyone remotely interested in the evolution of the avant-garde during the past half-century...<em>Words Without Music</em> [is] an important contribution to cultural history.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Steven G. Kellman, <em>Dallas Morning News</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Lively and colorful.... Glass is one of the most articulate composers around. Insight and practical common sense pervade his new book.... With a composer&#x2019;s sense of form, Glass returns, in the final pages, to his youth, the subject that elicits his most evocative writing.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Kyle Gann, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Well-supplied with droll observations and plainspoken assessments regarding the details of a career that has been as remarkable and noteworthy as any in American music&#x2015;indeed, in American culture.... Honest and candid.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Steve Smith, <em>Boston Globe</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Readers don&#x2019;t have to like Glass&#x2019;s music to find pleasure in this warm, unaffected, and deeply human book, but they may come away with an improved understanding of and a greater appreciation for both the music and its composer.... If a listener&#x2019;s view of a composer is one of the things that shapes his or her perception of the music, an autobiography that alters the composer&#x2019;s image should have the potential to change the way the music comes across. <em>Words Without Music</em> has done precisely that for me.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David Hajdu, <em>The Nation</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Philip Glass has written a fascinating account of his life with recollections of family, teachers, and friends. From his childhood in Baltimore to his studies with Ravi Shankar and Nadia Boulanger and the collaborations with Robert Wilson, Allen Ginsburg, Godfrey Reggio, and Martin Scorsese, among others, Glass offers insights to his music and personal life. <em>Words Without Music</em> will be a pleasure to read, not only for musicians (although they will particularly enjoy it) but for anyone interested in the world of art.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Paul Simon</strong><br><br>&#x201c;I came to Philip Glass&#x2019;s music very simply, without any critical prodding or guidance. I listened and was transfixed. I was excited to work with Philip on <em>Kundun</em>, and he exceeded my wildest expectations giving us a score that was genuinely transcendent.

Pow Wow, or Braucherei, as it is known by its practitioners, is a system of folk magic that has its roots in Christian and Pre-Christian Germany, but its character is wholy American - the quintissential American magical system. Drawing on quotes from the Bible, qabalistic principles and old gromoires, it is empowered by the Holy Trinity, and most practitioners consider themselves to be Christian, much like the Cunning Folk of England. The final chapter, about Doctor Santee, references material and uses a photograph that is copyright GLHoke, and used with permission. &#34;The Red Church: The Art of Pennsylvania German Braucherei is the finest book on German magic to be seen in decades. Comprehensive in its historical, philosophical and cultural roots, The Red Church is a book that will be appreciated by academics and modern practitioners of not just folk and ceremonial magic alike, but also energetic and faith healing, symbolism, and cultural psychology. Extensively researched and documented, no one interested in the survival of Medieval and Renaissance magic into the modern era should be without a copy of it within easy reach.&#34; - Mark Stavish, Director of Studies, Institute for Hermetic Studies, author of, The Path of Alchemy, Freemasonry - Rituals, Symbols and History of the Secret Society, and Between the Gates: Lucid Dreaming, Astral Projection and the Body of Light.</p><p>Every so often, amid the glut of rehashed popular culture that too often passes for originality in the occult field, something genuinely different and worthwhile comes along. Christopher Bilardi's 'The Red Church' is a fine example. At a time when the word "tradition" has become little more than a synonym for "brand name," Bilardi has pursued the study of an authentic occult tradition -- braucherei, the Pennsylvania Dutch system of magical curing -- and crafted a solidly researched, readable guide to this fascinating amalgam of archaic Germanic lore, Rosicrucian symbolism, and Christian folk magic. <p>Contemporary occultists, students of alternative healing methods, and readers interested in a colorful field of American folk culture will all want to make room on their shelves for 'The Red Church'. </p><p>John Michael Greer author of "The New Encyclopedia of the Occult" and "The Druidry Handbook" --John Michael Greer</p></p><h2>Horse Breeds of North America: The Pocket Guide to 96 Essential Breeds</h2><p><p>An amazing variety of horse breeds roam North America&#x2019;s vast and geographically diverse landscape.

When we picture California Ranch houses&#x2014;the low-slung, informal dwellings that engulfed suburbs after World War II&#x2014;we are thinking of just one part of a phenomenon that has its roots in early-nineteenth-century ranchos, and which continues today in houses that are startling and up-to-the-minute. Examples of the type have been called ranchos, ranchers, and California ramblers. They have been styled Spanish, Japanese, and French; Monterey and International; Vernacular, Minimalist, and Modernist. From the 1797 Rancho Los Alamitos of Long Beach to such contemporary homes as the Miller Residence of Corte Madera, Ranch Houses unveils the great variety and the very finest examples of this multifaceted form.

He is well remembered for his energetic persona, range of interests and achievements, leadership of the Progressive Movement, model of masculinity, and his "cowboy" image. He was a leader of the Republican Party and founder of the short-lived Progressive ("Bull Moose") Party of 1912. Before becoming President (1901&#x2013;1909) he held offices at the municipal, state, and federal level of government. Roosevelt's achievements as a naturalist, explorer, hunter, author, and soldier are as much a part of his fame as any office he held as a politician.

Are our bodies and brains truly at odds with modern life? Although it may seem as though we have barely had time to shed our hunter-gatherer legacy, biologist Marlene Zuk reveals that the story is not so simple. Popular theories about how our ancestors lived&#x2015;and why we should emulate them&#x2015;are often based on speculation, not scientific evidence.</p><p>Armed with a razor-sharp wit and brilliant, eye-opening research, Zuk takes us to the cutting edge of biology to show that evolution can work much faster than was previously realized, meaning that we are not biologically the same as our caveman ancestors. Contrary to what the glossy magazines would have us believe, we do not enjoy potato chips because they crunch just like the insects our forebears snacked on. And women don&#x2019;t go into shoe-shopping frenzies because their prehistoric foremothers gathered resources for their clans. As Zuk compellingly argues, such beliefs incorrectly assume that we&#x2019;re stuck&#x2015;finished evolving&#x2015;and have been for tens of thousands of years. She draws on fascinating evidence that examines everything from adults&#x2019; ability to drink milk to the texture of our ear wax to show that we&#x2019;ve actually never stopped evolving. Our nostalgic visions of an ideal evolutionary past in which we ate, lived, and reproduced as we were &#x201c;meant to&#x201d; fail to recognize that we were never perfectly suited to our environment. Evolution is about change, and every organism is full of trade-offs.</p><p>From debunking the caveman diet to unraveling gender stereotypes, Zuk delivers an engrossing analysis of widespread paleofantasies and the scientific evidence that undermines them, all the while broadening our understanding of our origins and what they can really tell us about our present and our future.</p> 15 illustrations</p><p>Marlene Zuk is a professor of ecology, evolution and behavior at the University of Minnesota.

They still called it sunrise, even if the &#x201c;sun&#x201d; was officially named Capella and lay some thirty light- ears from Earth. This particular morning began as a brilliant spear of light behind the craggy black silhouette of the Blood Mountains. Donovan rotated in the same direction as Earth, so sunrise was still in the east.<br><br> Aching with fatigue and possessed of a pervading sense of futility, Talina would have preferred to be back at Port Authority. She would have awakened this morning, rested and energized from a full night&#x2019;s sleep. Instead she stank of sweat, her feet and legs spotted with dried mud, her overalls filthy and smudged. Her skin stung from thorn punctures that she hadn&#x2019;t been able to avoid in the darkness.<br><br>As the first light spilled through the distant gap, she desperately wanted to believe the morning myth, to lower her guard and yawn. Maybe let her mind wander. <br><br>Except that she&#x2019;d seen too many sunrises play across the rictus on a freshly dead man&#x2019;s face. <br> Donovan did that, destroyed illusion with brutal regularity. <br><br>As the dawn brightened, its light softened the angles and contours of the canyon&#x2014;sifted shadow and form from the darkness. <br><br>She crouched on a precarious trail, body tense, the heavy rifle tightly gripped in her slim and tanned fingers. Her dark eyes shifted constantly, desperately searching the shadows. The charge was almost depleted in her thermal scope. Overhead, two of the drones scoured the canyon sides, the hiss of their fans barely audible. <br><br>Capella&#x2019;s first rays caressed her face, warming her high cheeks and straight nose as they gave a golden cast to her bronzed skin. They illumi�nated her ancestral features of Spanish hidalgo mixed with classic Maya. Descended from sun gods and conquistadors, their spirit flashed in her sable eyes as she stalked the wild and rocky trails of another world. <br><br>Talina Perez hunted a killer. <br><br>She pursed her full lips and brushed back a strand of black hair where it had come loose from her long braid. Hair that adopted a bluish raven tint in the full morning light. <br><br>Warm air drifted down the canyon, carrying the odor of dry dirt and the cloying scent of musk bushes. The silence seemed to intensify as Capella&#x2019;s light accented the parched surface of cracked and tum�bled stone with pale lavender; high above, it bathed the shredded cir�rus clouds in purple and orange streaks where they stretched across the northern sky. <br><br>Invertebrates whizzed and chirred in the tangles of brush beneath the sandstone outcrops. To her right the canyon dropped away to a stone-and-sand-choked streambed some twenty meters below. <br><br>She swallowed nervously and snugged the rifle butt into her shoul�der. Her gaze searched the cap rock above for any irregularity. Then she turned her attention to the narrowing gap where the trail climbed the canyon wall and emptied out onto the flat tableland above. Dotted with aquajade trees and ferngrass, the plain extended to the distant Wind Mountains where they rose some twenty kilometers beyond. <br><br>&#x201c;Where the hell are you?&#x201d; she whispered. <br><br>She tried to still her pounding heart in order to hear even the faintest sound. Changing her focus, she gave careful scrutiny to the ground, looking for scuffed soil, a displaced rock, a broken thorn, or a bruised leaf on one of the plants. <br><br>Because of a dead battery in a motion sensor, the quetzal had come undetected in the night, crossed the defensive ditch, unhooked the gate latch, and slipped into town. That was the thing about quetzals, they were intelligent. Learned from their mistakes. This one obviously had previous experience with humans and knew the defenses. After the creature made its kill, it had known how to escape, charging head�long for the uplands. That was another thing about quetzals: for short distances they could run faster than an aircar. <br><br>The planet hosted an endless variety of different and deadly beasts. Bems, though solitary and slow, relied on extraordinary camouflage and deadly claws to capture prey. The creature they called the night�mare inhabited the tropical jungle stretches just south of Port Au�thority. Also a master of camouflage, it mimicked the surrounding vegetation and invoked a special kind of horror: it first impaled and then devoured victims from the inside out. Fortunately nightmares almost exclusively lurked in mundo trees down south. Smaller threats like the slugs, spikes, and semisentient stinging, poisonous, and pred�atory plants filled out most of the rest of the <i>known </i>dangerous flora and fauna. <br> <i><br>&#x201c;Talina? You on the trail?&#x201d; </i>Allenovich&#x2019;s voice came through her ear�piece. <br><br>She shifted her rifle, eyes still on the thornbushes as they rotated their branches to expose night-weary leaves to the rising sun. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m maybe three hundred meters from the head of the canyon.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;<i>Still got tracks?&#x201d; </i><br><br>Talina filled her lungs, hating the way her heart was hammering at her breastbone. &#x201c;No. They vanished about fifty meters back.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;<i>Shit.&#x201d; </i>A pause. <i>&#x201c;You watch your ass.&#x201d; </i><br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; she whispered and wished for a drink of water. <br> <i><br>&#x201c;Trish here. I&#x2019;m on the rim just across the canyon from you, Tal. Iji says the drones are reporting that nothing broke out onto the flat up ahead. It&#x2019;ll take a while to recall them. I&#x2019;m scanning the canyon with the IR. With the morning sun, that slope you&#x2019;re on is a patchwork of heat signatures. You sure it&#x2019;s there?&#x201d; </i><br><br>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d; She swallowed hard, the rifle up, her pulse racing. &#x201c;I can al�most . . .&#x201d; <br><br>A trickle of dirt broke loose to cascade from above. <br><br>Talina dropped to one knee, the rifle lifted for a snap shot as she stared through the optic. <br><br>What? <br><br>Where? <br><br>The buzzing of the invertebrates changed; the chime shifted as if a whole section of them had gone quiet. Odd, that. <br><br>A pebble clicked and bounced down through the rocks and into the scrubby thorn brush above. <br>Quetzal? Or just the morning sun expanding the eroded soil? <br> <i><br>Damn, I hate this! </i><br><br>Her muscles remained bunched like knotted wire. Something about the invertebrates . . . <br><br>&#x201c;Trish?&#x201d; she barely whispered. &#x201c;See anything above me?&#x201d; <br><br>Why the hell couldn&#x2019;t humans have eyes in the backs of their heads? <br><br>The morning air had grown heavy, oppressive. <br> <i><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t make out anything definitive, Tal. Be damned careful. We don&#x2019;t want to bury you, too.&#x201d; </i><br><br>&#x201c;Affirmative on that.&#x201d; <br><br>The quetzal had prowled the town, tracks indicating where it had avoided adults&#x2014;aware of their weapons&#x2014;and skirted the lighted areas. Sticking to the shadows and back ways, it had made its way to the personal quarters, stopping only long enough to peer into the domes and try the doors. <br><br>At Allison Chomko&#x2019;s it had found safe prey, had watched her leave her house on an errand. Then the creature had raised the unlocked latch before entering to make its kill. It had escaped, gone before any�one knew.<br><br>A running quetzal made an incredible sight with its flared collar membranes spread for thermal regulation. Its mouth gaped wide to expose serrated jaws, which acted as a sort of ram-air intake. Pushed into three separate lungs, oxygen supercharged the blood. As air was channeled through the body core, it picked up heat and was exhaled, or vented, above the powerful legs and along the tail. All six meters of the animal would turn blaze-white for better radiation. A quetzal running in panic across flat terrain could hit one hundred and sixty kph for short periods of time. <br><br>But it came at an incredible cost in energy; and here, in the canyon, it had gone to ground. By now it would have digested the infant girl it had taken from Allison Chomko&#x2019;s cradle. Before it could run again, it had to eat, to replace those depleted resources. <br><br>Talina could sense the quetzal&#x2019;s hunger, sense the creature&#x2019;s three shining black eyes as they studied her. As if the gaze were somehow radiant. <br><br>The invertebrates began another chime&#x2014;like a mutual wave of sound that passed from critter to critter. Talina was barely aware as it rolled slowly up from the canyon&#x2019;s mouth. <br><br>The fine hair on the nape of her neck rose. <br> <i><br>How can a creature that big turn invisible? </i><br><br>But that was the way of so many of Donovan&#x2019;s creatures: masters of camouflage, all of them. <br><br>Arguments raged in Inga&#x2019;s tavern. Were quetzals&#x2014;in their way&#x2014;as smart as humans? They hunted with uncanny ability, manipulated locks, doors, and tools&#x2014;but made none of their own. <br>Here, in the canyon, the predator&#x2019;s cunning permeated the very air. A metaphysical odor borne on the currents of the soul. <br> <i><br>One small slip, Talina. That&#x2019;s all it takes. Stay crisp&#x2014;or you&#x2019;ll die here. </i><br><br>Talina took another step, senses at high pitch. People had stepped on quetzals before, oblivious to their presence until that shift of slip�pery flesh beneath a misplaced foot. For their part, the creatures had learned that a human could be efficiently eliminated by a strike to the head, chest, or neck. All it took was a pistonlike blow from one of their clawed, three-toed feet. <br><br>Nerve sweat trickled down Talina&#x2019;s cheek. Capella was a full hand-width above the horizon now, its heat beginning to radiate on the canyon wall. The chirring of the invertebrates swelled, covering any sound&#x2014;as if the &#x201c;bugs&#x201d; were cheering the quetzal on. <br> <i><br>Let it go! Just back away! </i><br><br>But she couldn&#x2019;t. This one was too cunning a killer. It would be back. Smarter. Faster. More deadly. <br><br>The air pulsed with chime, beating a rhythm that was echoed by the land. Thorncactus reached out with a tentative branch, its spines scratching along her boot&#x2019;s protective leather. <br><br>Talina flinched, wheeled, rifle up as she stared at the trail behind her. Empty. <br><br>If the thing would just move, the drones would detect it, give her that moment of warning. But for the drones they&#x2019;d never have tracked the beast this far. <br><br>Another swelling of sound rolled up the canyon as the inverte�brates song-shared. The chime passed her, heading for the head of the canyon. <br><br>Yes! There! A break in the wall of sound&#x2014;a dead spot of uncharac�teristic silence just off to the left&#x2014;slightly above the trail and not more than ten paces away. <br><br>She fixed on it, lowered her cheek to the stock and squinted through the optic. The soil began to flow. A plant seemed to thin, as if reality had turned sideways. A shadow formed in dislodged dirt. Three black eyes emerged from behind mottled, soil-toned lids. <br><br>The moment their gazes fixed, they might have shared souls, touched each other&#x2019;s deadly essences. <br><br>Talina shot as the quetzal leaped. Explosive-tipped bullets ripped into the rock and brush that surrounded the three eyes that seemed to rise before her. <br><br>She reeled back. Lost her footing and hit hard on the uneven stones. Somehow she kept her hold on the rifle, brought it up. <br><br>The quetzal&#x2019;s camouflaged colors darkened as the creature landed, bunched, and launched itself. <br> Talina had a momentary image of its wide mouth, the wickedly serrated teeth. Then it blocked the sky as it hurtled toward her. <br><br>She was screaming as she held the trigger back. The rifle thundered as she kicked sideways, flung herself downhill off the trail. The quetzal slammed hard feet into the spot where she&#x2019;d been, one claw cutting her sleeve. <br><br>The world spun as Talina tumbled down the slope, tore through the vegetation, bounced off rocks. She slammed onto a weather-rotten outcrop; sandstone crumbled under her weight. The side of her head hit a rock. Lightning and pain blasted through her skull. Her body bounced, landed on loose scree, slid, and broke through a young aquajade tree. <br><br>Suddenly she was weightless, falling. The creek bottom stopped her cold, the impact smacked both breath and sense out of her. <br><br>Stunned, vision blurred, she came to. Shocked nerves jangled in her limbs. Synapses overloaded and screamed. She tried to move&#x2014;and gasped. Pain, like fire, burned through her body. <br> <i><br>What the hell? Where am I? What the fuck happened? </i><br><br>Accident. <br> <i><br>Yes, I know this feeling. </i><br><br>The distant bang of a rifle bored past the ringing in her ears. <br> <i><br>Who&#x2019;s shooting? </i><br><br>Panic caused her to reach out, slap a torn and bleeding hand on a large rock. She was in a canyon bottom. <br><br>An image burst into her stumbling brain: <i>quetzal. Baby killer. </i><br><br>&#x201c;Hunting me,&#x201d; she whispered as she reached up to wipe at her eyes&#x2014;and couldn&#x2019;t, given the long thorns sticking out of her hand. <br><br>Dirt and rocks came cascading from somewhere above. A bullet exploded on stone, followed by the crack of a rifle. <br><br>Trish! <br><br>Talina whimpered as she pulled herself upright and struggled to see through her swimming eyes. Branches snapped above. Pretty clumsy work on the quetzal&#x2019;s part. <br><br>Clumsy? Why? <br><br>Another bullet popped as it exploded above the cut bank no more than three meters above her. <br><br>Talina tried to stand. The numb burning in her leg changed to a white-hot and searing pain that speared through her fumbling brain. She managed to focus on her oddly twisted leg. <i>Broken! </i><br><br>The quetzal slipped sideways above her as another of Trish&#x2019;s bullets exploded in the dirt where the creature had been but an instant be�fore. Then it dropped over the edge, feet thudding into the streambed a couple of meters from Talina&#x2019;s boots. <br><br>The quetzal gleamed, skin shining, reflecting streaks of black and yellow with the legs mottling into blackened umber on those deadly three-toed feet. Behind the creature&#x2019;s elongated head, the neck expanded; the flaring collar burst into crimson glory. <br><br>Talina&#x2019;s hand&#x2014;heedless of the thorns&#x2014;slapped for her holstered pistol. To her horror, the holster was empty, the pistol lost during the tumble down the slope. <br><br>The quetzal fixed her with its three black and gleaming eyes. The beast wobbled as if hurt. Took a step, then another. <br><br>The quetzal uttered an eerie moan as it raised itself sluggishly. Less than a meter separated her from the three vitreous eyes. The creature blasted out a trilling whistle mixed with a hiss of rage. Crystal drops of moisture caught the light in diamond sparkles where they beaded on the razor-ranks of teeth. <br><br>&#x201c;So, you&#x2019;re taking as many with you as you can,&#x201d; Talina told it, dazzled by the glow behind those angry eyes. And in that instant, she could sense the alien intelligence behind that stare. <br><br>&#x201c;Not that I blame you.&#x201d; <br><br>The quetzal replied with a clicking down in its iridescent throat, as if in agreement. <br><br>Why the hell hadn&#x2019;t Trish taken the final shot? What was keep�ing . . . Of course, this far down into the narrow-walled canyon, Trish didn&#x2019;t have a shot. Couldn&#x2019;t see the target. <br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, pal.&#x201d; Talina granted the beast a weary smile. Blood was run�ning down the side of her head. <br><br>The beast kept wobbling on its feet, mortally wounded. Gaze still fixed on hers, it tilted its head, as though in an effort to understand. It gestured with one of the wickedly clawed forefeet, as if demanding something of her.

Both were legendary leaders of religious and spiritual traditions many still label as evil.</p><p>The Laveaus were free women of color and prominent French-speaking Catholic Creoles. From the 1820s until the 1880s when one died and the other disappeared, gossip, fear, and fierce affection swirled about them. From the heart of the French Quarter, in dance, drumming, song, and spirit possession, they ruled the imagination of New Orleans.</p><p>How did the two Maries apply their "magical" powers and uncommon business sense to shift the course of love, luck, and the law? The women understood the real crime--they had pitted their spiritual forces against the slave system of the United States. Moses-like, they led their people out of bondage and offered protection and freedom to the community of color, rich white women, enslaved families, and men condemned to hang.</p><p>The curse of the Laveau family, however, followed them. Both loved men they could never marry. Both faced down the press and police who stalked them. Both countered the relentless gossip of curses, evil spirits, murders, and infant sacrifice with acts of benevolence.</p><p>The book is also a detective story--who is really buried in the famous tomb in the oldest "city of the dead" in New Orleans? What scandals did the Laveau family intend to keep buried there forever? By what sleight of hand did free people of color lose their cultural identity when Americans purchased Louisiana and imposed racial apartheid upon Creole creativity? <i>Voodoo Queen</i> brings the improbable testimonies of saints, spirits, and never-before-printed eyewitness accounts of ceremonies and magical crafts together to illuminate the lives of the two Marie Laveaus, leaders of a major, indigenous American religion.</p></p><p>The lives and times of the two most powerful spiritual women in Creole New OrleansThe lives and times of the two most powerful spiritual women in Creole New Orleans <p>Includes </p><p>History of nineteenth-century New Orleans </p><p>Account of voodoo religious practice in New Orleans </p><p>Story of both Marie Laveaus, a mother and daughter team </p><p>Struggles of Marie Laveau against New Orleans police and journalists </p><p>Efforts by Marie Laveau to represent and empower Creole population </p><p>New understanding of Marie Laveau as healer and helper to poor and oppressed </p><p>Description of Laveaus' many battles against slavery system of the United States</p></p><h2>Invincible Volume 19: The War At Home (Invincible, 19)</h2><p><ul> <li>Angstrom Levy returns to take revenge on Invincible and all those he holds dear!</li></ul><br></p><p></p><h2>Crystal Healing &amp; The Human Energy Field A Beginners Guide</h2><p>This book is about energy and vibrations and is ideal for those who are beginning to learn about the human energy field.

In THE WAYS OF MENTAL PRAYER he offers a systematic presentation of the teachings on contemplative prayer of St. Teresa of Avila, St. John of the Cross, St. Francis of Sales, St. Alphonsus of Liguori, St. Bernard of Clairvaux, and many more. Part One introduces the reader to contemplative or &#34;mental&#34; prayer. Part Two gives instructions for discursive meditation, affective prayer, and the prayer of simplicity. &#34;As time goes on,&#34; writes the author, &#34;and we make progress, we shall feel drawn to a more simple form of prayer, in which the mind begins to be silent in order to let the heart speak.&#34; Part Three describes the mystical states of quiet and union, and gives practical advice for those graced with these higher forms of prayer.</p><p></p><h2>We Never Asked for Wings: A Novel</h2><p><b>From the beloved <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Language of Flowers</i> comes her much-anticipated new novel about young love, hard choices, and hope against all odds.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> For fourteen years, Letty Espinosa has worked three jobs around San Francisco to make ends meet while her mother raised her children&#x2014;Alex, fifteen, and Luna, just six&#x2014;in their tiny apartment on a forgotten spit of wetlands near the bay.

Luna was curled into a ball, doing that thing she did when she wanted someone to believe she was still asleep: eyes scrunched too tightly closed, lips pulled down at the corners because Alex had told her once that she smiled when she faked sleep, so now she overcorrected. Wisps of long black hair had escaped her braids and tangled around her gold earrings; a smudge of drool flaked white off her cheek. Checking to see who was there, she squinted at Alex through crusted eyelashes and then snapped her eyes shut again. Where she&#x2019;d recently lost her two front teeth, her gums were swollen and red.<br><br>How could he possibly tell her?<br><br>She was only six. Only six and tiny too&#x2014;�even with their grandmother cooking constantly, there were weeks she lost weight instead of gaining it, and she didn&#x2019;t have any to lose. What would he feed her? He felt again the despair washing over him, as it had when he&#x2019;d first woken up and read the letter; with puffed cheeks, he held his breath until it passed. Everything is going to be fine, he told himself. Everything is going to be just fine. He was fourteen years old, fifteen in a month. He&#x2019;d been watching his grandmother long enough to know what to do. But it wouldn&#x2019;t be easy. Luna wasn&#x2019;t the kind of kid who just listened. Getting her to do anything took extensive negotiation, distraction, and occasionally&#x2014;�even with his grandmother&#x2014;�bribery.<br><br>Alex decided to skip straight to the bribery.<br><br>&#x201c;Too bad Luna&#x2019;s not awake, because I&#x2019;m about to have donuts for breakfast.&#x201d;<br><br>She pressed her face into the pillow to muffle a squeal and clamped her hands over her ears as if this might prevent their grandmother from hearing. It was breaking three rules, at least: (1) Stopping anywhere on the way to school, (2) Eating sugar before noon, and (3) Eating donuts, ever.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, she isn&#x2019;t here.&#x201d;<br><br>Luna peeled away from the pillow. Her brown eyes studied Alex, looking for clues as to how she should feel about this unfamiliar state of being. &#x201c;Where is she?&#x201d;<br><br>He forced himself to smile. &#x201c;Mom took her to get Grandpa.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They found him?&#x201d;<br><br>Alex paused, then moved his head in a kind of circle, a motion that Luna would interpret as a yes but that was ambiguous enough to get Alex off if he was ever questioned for lying at the gates of heaven. He&#x2019;d hidden his grandmother&#x2019;s letter behind the tip jar his mother kept in the kitchen cabinet, which he&#x2019;d hoped would be full (she&#x2019;d taken most of the money, though, leaving only three inches of coins at the bottom of the jar) and estimated the time it would take for them to return by the miles to Oro de Hidalgo and back, calculated at seventy miles an hour. Best case scenario: &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be back on Friday.&#x201d;<br><br>Luna was quiet, and for a minute Alex thought she was worrying, as he was, about how his mother would get his grandparents, Maria Elena and Enrique, back across the border&#x2014;�or whether they would get back at all. But then she asked what day it was.<br><br>&#x201c;Tuesday.&#x201d;<br><br>She hummed the days of the week to the tune of &#x201c;Clementine&#x201d; and counted on her fingers. &#x201c;Three days.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly. Three days of eating whatever we want and staying after school with our friends.&#x201d;<br><br>They didn&#x2019;t have any friends; Luna did not look convinced.<br><br>He squeezed her feet through the blankets, trying to think of something to comfort her. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been alone before, remember?&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded, fear in her eyes for the first time, and he realized too late that it was the wrong thing to say. They&#x2019;d both gotten stomachaches from the potatoes he&#x2019;d half-�baked, and she&#x2019;d cried, inconsolably, the whole night through. That time, Maria Elena hadn&#x2019;t meant to leave them alone. She and Enrique had gone out of town and hired a babysitter, but the girl got sick and left, and even though they&#x2019;d called Letty in a panic, she hadn&#x2019;t come home until six o&#x2019;clock in the morning.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m older now,&#x201d; he said and then, because he couldn&#x2019;t think of anything else to say: &#x201c;Sprinkles?&#x201d;<br><br>Luna studied him. &#x201c;Are we really going to get donuts?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you ever get out of bed, we are.&#x201d; She reached out, and he pulled her up and set her on the floor. &#x201c;Need help?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nana said I could wear my heart dress. She said she&#x2019;d wash it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know where it is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But she said.&#x201d;<br><br>It was exactly the kind of conversation that could spiral into hysteria; the recovery would take half the morning. &#x201c;Hold on.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked in the closet, where his grandmother hung the clothes she&#x2019;d ironed, and then in the kitchen sink, where she soaked things overnight; finally, he found it on the drying rack in the stairwell, stretched flat on top of a towel.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s wet,&#x201d; Luna said when he handed it to her.<br><br>&#x201c;So wear it wet, or wear something dry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I want to wear this. And I don&#x2019;t want it to be wet.&#x201d;<br><br>She held her dress by the sleeves and swung it around in a circle. The material flew just inches from his face. He reached out and grabbed it.<br><br>&#x201c;Stop that. Come here.&#x201d; From her dresser he found leggings and a long-�sleeved shirt, and dressed her in both before pulling the damp dress over her head. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t even tell it&#x2019;s wet.&#x201d;<br><br>Luna wrinkled her nose. &#x201c;But why are we even going to school?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Please, please, please, can we stay home and watch TV?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; Alex said. They were so different, he and his sister, that sometimes he couldn&#x2019;t believe they were even related. But then, Alex was different from just about everyone he&#x2019;d ever met. While the other eighth graders in his class read banned magazines behind textbooks and painted their nails under their desks and avoided answering questions, Alex came to school every day armed with some strange fact to shock or impress his teacher. Most of these facts he got from his grandfather, the only person he knew who was like him. Enrique could recite the name of every bird that traveled the Pacific Flyway in alphabetical order, a skill he&#x2019;d learned from his own father, and his grandfather before that. Alex had been able to do it for as long as he could remember.<br><br>Grabbing his clothes from the closet, he went to the bathroom to get dressed. Behind the locked door he pulled on the white shirt his grandmother had ironed. The kids at Cesar Chavez called him &#x201c;Newsman&#x201d; because of his shirts, but Alex knew he looked nothing like a television reporter. He was too skinny, for one, and his nose had grown before the rest of his face. But the real problem with Alex&#x2019;s appearance was his hair: a wavy, almost-�blond mop he assumed he&#x2019;d inherited from his father. Alex had never seen him, but in a shoe box under Letty&#x2019;s bed was a sealed envelope addressed to Wes Riley, 536 Elm Street, Mission Hills, California. When he&#x2019;d searched the name on his school computer, Alex had found images of a man who looked almost exactly like him&#x2014;�blue eyes, milky skin, and a square jaw. In every photograph he wore scrubs and held a different dark-�skinned baby. The captions read &#x201c;Mumbai,&#x201d; &#x201c;Malawi,&#x201d; &#x201c;Guatemala City.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d been given some kind of award in 2005, but the article about it was written in an African language Alex didn&#x2019;t recognize and couldn&#x2019;t understand.<br><br>But of all the information he&#x2019;d gathered about his father, the address was the thing that most captivated him. It was just over the freeway. For years, Alex had imagined walking past the house, his father recognizing him from the window and rushing out. He&#x2019;d never gotten far enough from Maria Elena&#x2019;s watchful eye to venture there alone, though, and he&#x2019;d never summoned the courage to ask his mother about the man or the circumstances of his birth&#x2014;�mostly because he&#x2019;d never summoned the courage to ask his mother about anything at all.<br><br>He brushed his teeth quickly as Luna pounded on the door.<br><br>&#x201c;Alex! Let me in.&#x201d;<br><br>***<br><br>Maria Elena had packed their lunches for the week and stacked them on the top shelf of the refrigerator, all labeled. alex: tuesday, luna: tuesday, and behind those the Wednesdays, the Thursdays, and the Fridays. Below their lunches were the remnants of every meal their grandmother had made for the last two weeks, stored and dated and&#x2014;�Alex could imagine the smell without cracking open the lids&#x2014;�many edging toward decay. He pulled out the Tuesday lunches and stuffed them in their backpacks, checking to see that their tennis shoes were still at the bottoms of the bags, where they belonged.<br><br>From the bathroom, he heard the toilet flush and the faucet turn on and off, and then Luna stood in the doorway. Water dripped onto her forehead, from where she&#x2019;d slicked the loose hair back into her braids. If her teacher ever noticed anything, she would notice that Luna&#x2019;s hair had not been rebraided that morning for the very first time all year. But Luna was the least of her teacher&#x2019;s problems&#x2014;�she probably wouldn&#x2019;t even look at her the entire day.<br><br>Fishing through the tip jar, Alex extracted a stack of quarters and stepped into his rain boots. He handed Luna hers: knee-�high with pink polka dots. They were the one item of clothing necessary to survive life at the Landing, and the one thing his grandmother did not buy generic. Luna pulled them on.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s still there, did you see?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is?&#x201d;<br><br>She gestured for him to follow. In their grandparents&#x2019; room, the bed was made as it always was, the quilt pulled tight and square, but he saw immediately that things were different. Only a nail remained where a small cross had hung over the bed; the top of his grandmother&#x2019;s dresser was empty of photographs and glistened with some kind of polish. Alex imagined her dusting while she packed. Luna pulled him across the room to where his grandfather&#x2019;s workbench sat under the window, his most recent project spread out exactly as he&#x2019;d left it.<br><br>For six months, their grandfather had been focused on a single feather mosaic, a landscape of a rural village in Mexico, with small stucco houses tilting in imperfect rows and a shawl-�wrapped woman looking up at a full moon. It was only the profile of the woman, and she was young, but Alex could tell it was his grandmother. It was always his grandmother. The feather work was so fine that from a few feet away it could be mistaken for an oil painting, each feather a single stroke, but instead the mosaic was created entirely of naturally occurring feathers stuck into a thin layer of campeche wax. The smell of wax hung heavy in the air, and it made him miss his grandfather intensely: the way he patted his thighs every time Alex stepped into the room, even after Alex grew too big to sit in his lap; the way he stopped everything to stand up and look outside, narrating the natural world for his grandson, who remembered every word he said.<br><br>Enrique had been gone for six weeks, returning to Mexico to be with his dying mother, and now Maria Elena and Letty were gone too. Alex moved to the window and looked out at the empty landscape.<br><br>They were completely alone.<br><br>More alone than seemed reasonable, given that they stood less than twenty miles south of San Francisco. Most of the time he didn&#x2019;t notice the isolation, or else he tried to think about only the good things: the birds, the view, the water. But every once in a while it hit him. Where was civilization? Outside, Mile Road stretched through the empty marsh, from Highway 101 to the edge of the bay, ending at the three squat buildings of Eden&#x2019;s Landing: Building A, painted an industrial peachy brown; Building B, half a shade darker of the same dull color; and Building C, closest to the water and painted a faded robin&#x2019;s-�egg blue. A barbed-�wire fence separated the Landing from the San Francisco International Airport to the north; nothing but a stretch of ever-�shifting wetlands separated it from the bankrupt blight of Bayshore to the south. There were other towns nearby, nice ones like Hillsborough and Burlingame and San Mateo, but the expansion of the 101 freeway had cut off the Landing and Bayshore from the rest of the peninsula. Alex could see Mission Hills, the most affluent of the suburbs, directly across the freeway from where he stood&#x2014;�but it felt like a world away.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll come back. Won&#x2019;t he?&#x201d; Luna asked, interrupting his thoughts. She was studying her grandfather&#x2019;s mosaic. In a ring around the full moon the wax showed through, chocolate-�colored and sticky; beside it, blue-�black feathers poked from the top of a labeled envelope as if waiting for his return.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course he will,&#x201d; Alex said.<br><br>But he wasn&#x2019;t sure.<br><br>Just before his grandfather left, Alex had complained that they didn&#x2019;t have even one piece of Enrique&#x2019;s work. He&#x2019;d been sitting beside him at his workbench, as he did every day after school, separating the striped from the solid feathers of a marsh wren. Enrique had nodded solemnly but hadn&#x2019;t said anything, and now he was gone.<br><br>Perhaps he&#x2019;d left the mosaic for them on purpose, Alex thought: a silent apology for his sudden flight.</p><h2>Notre-Dame: A Short History of the Meaning of Cathedrals</h2><p><p>&#x2018;Two days after Notre Dame burned, I flew to Paris to appear on the TV programme <i>La Grande Librairie </i>for a discussion about cathedrals.

Students are faced with a disconnect between the algorithmic and informal attitude to mathematics at school, versus a new emphasis on proof, based on logic, and a more abstract development of general concepts, based on set theory.<br> <br>The authors have many years' experience of the potential difficulties involved, through teaching first-year undergraduates and researching the ways in which students and mathematicians think. The book explains the motivation behind abstract foundational material based on students' experiences of school mathematics, and explicitly suggests ways students can make sense of formal ideas.<br><br>This second edition takes a significant step forward by not only making the transition from intuitive to formal methods, but also by reversing the process- using structure theorems to prove that formal systems have visual and symbolic interpretations that enhance mathematical thinking. This is exemplified by a new chapter on the theory of groups. <br><br>While the first edition extended counting to infinite cardinal numbers, the second also extends the real numbers rigorously to larger ordered fields. This links intuitive ideas in calculus to the formal epsilon-delta methods of analysis. The approach here is not the conventional one of 'nonstandard analysis', but a simpler, graphically based treatment which makes the notion of an infinitesimal natural and straightforward. <br><br>This allows a further vision of the wider world of mathematical thinking in which formal definitions and proof lead to amazing new ways of defining, proving, visualising and symbolising mathematics beyond previous expectations.<br></p><p><br>Ian Stewart, <em>Emeritus Professor, University of Warwick</em>,David Tall, <em>Emeritus Professor, University of Warwick</em><br><br>Ian Stewart is Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Warwick.

In addition&#x2014;within each continent&#x2014;physical, political, and regional mapping is presented at the same scale, which allows the reader to compare map information easily and accurately. This feature of a fixed scale for regions provides the reader the option to roam from one end of a continent to its other end, flipping through the pages, while maintaining a constant scale.<br> &nbsp;<br> The atlas is organized as follows:<br> The Front matter with its new spreads on data collection and then data processing.<br> The World: with 25 spreads on Natural and Human themes including: Tectonics, the Biosphere, World Energy, World Health, Nutrition, and Literacy, and Technology and Globilization.<br> The atlas then zooms into Continental coverage:<br> Like the world thematic section, each of these continental parts will cover many important natural and human themes such as climate, natural hazards, income/GDP, and Trade. In addition, core political, regional coverage completes each continent's signature of human boundaries and places.<br> The fascinating polar regions and the vast world oceans come next.<br> Finally, abundant, clear, and precise appendices provide an invaluable back matter, reference section. A 105-page, place-name index is included as well.<br> &nbsp;<br> Careful selection of place-names and features make the maps very informative but not overly cluttered. Computer-generated shading enhances the look of the political maps while providing valuable information on topography.

In Before the Fact the main character, wealthy but plain Lina McLaidlaw, marries feckless Johnny Aysgarth, against the advice of her father. Lina is certain she can change him for the better, until she is forced to acknowledge that he is a compulsive liar, a crook and a murderer. But still she loves him, while fearing she will inevitably become one of his victims. Written in the age of Agatha Christie&#39;s mysteries, this novel turns the storytelling on its head, introducing you to the murderer early on before going on to explore the psychology of the relationship between murderer and victim in enthralling detail.</p><p>Francis Iles is the pseudonym of Anthony Berkeley Cox, one of the founders of the Detection Club and an influential figure in the development of crime fiction writingWritten by one of the forgotten masters of the Golden Age of British detective fiction (who also wrote under the name of Anthony Berkley), this novel-adapted by Alfred Hitchcock as SUSPICION-tells of a woman trapped by her own doubts and gullibility in a marriage to a man who may be a murderer. With a voice very pleasant to listen to, Bruce Montague guides the listener from the charmed courtship to the sinister climax with his slow, precise, slightly elegant speaking style. The British actor uses his comforting pace to complement the idyllic, almost Austenesque country life of the couple, giving stark contrast to the ominous events occurring in the background.

Mischa Elman, Jascha Heifetz, and Efrem Zimbalist (Sr.) were among Auer's students. Himself a pupil of the great Joseph Joachim, Auer will always be regarded as one of the most important violin pedagogues in history.<br>This exemplary collection of principles and guidelines was set down by the master after a lifetime of playing and teaching. Auer taught by example, and he directs violin teachers to inculcate the intricacies of execution by means of the violin itself, not simply by verbal instruction. He then devotes the rest of his advice to the violin pupil: how to hold the violin and bow, how to practice, and how to approach such matters of technique as tone production, <i>vibrato,</i> bowing methods including the <i>legato,</i> left-handed technique, double stops, trills, <i>pizzicato,</i> harmonics, and phrasing. In the concluding chapters Auer takes up the more general topics of style, stage fright, changes in the violin repertory, and, of great historical interest, his practical repertory hints &#x2015; what he gave his own students to play. Many of the book's chapters are illuminated by biographical details and anecdotes about famous musicians whom Auer knew: Davidov, Wieniawski, Seidel, Wilhemj, Sarasate, and von Bulow. <br>Receiving poor direction at an early age is disastrous for a violinist. As Auer says, "There is no instrument whose absolute mastery at a later period presupposes such meticulous care and exactitude in the initial stages of study as does the violin." With this book every beginning violin student will have the benefit of the finest guidance.</p><p></p><h2>An Epidemic of Absence: A New Way of Understanding Allergies and Autoimmune Diseases</h2><p><b>A brilliant, groundbreaking report on the dramatic rise of allergic and autoimmune disease, and the controversial therapies scientists are developing to correct these disorders.</b><br><br>From asthma to Crohn&#x2019;s disease, everyone knows someone who suffers from an allergic or autoimmune disorder. And if it appears that the prevalence of these maladies has increased recently, that&#x2019;s because it has&#x2014;to levels never before seen in human history. These days no fewer than one in five&#x2014;and likely more&#x2014;Americans suffers from one of these ailments. We seem newly, and bafflingly, vulnerable to immune system malfunction. Why? One possibility is that we have systematically cleaned ourselves to illness; this belief challenges deeply entrenched notions about the value of societal hygiene and the harmful nature of microbes. Yet scientists investigating the rampant immune dysfunction in the developed world have inevitably arrived at this conclusion. To address this global &#x201c;epidemic of absence,&#x201d; they must restore the human ecosystem.<br> <br>This groundbreaking book explores the promising but controversial &#x201c;worm therapy&#x201d;&#x2014;deliberate infection with parasitic worms&#x2014;in development to treat autoimmune disease. It explains why farmers&#x2019; children so rarely get hay fever, why allergy is less prevalent in former Eastern Bloc countries, and how one cancer-causing bacterium may be good for us. It probes the link between autism and a dysfunctional immune system. It investigates the newly apparent fetal origins of allergic disease&#x2014;that a mother&#x2019;s inflammatory response imprints on her unborn child, tipping the scales toward allergy. <br> <br><i>An Epidemic of Absence</i> is a brilliant, cutting-edge exploration of the dramatic rise of allergic and autoimmune diseases and the controversial, potentially groundbreaking therapies that scientists are developing to correct these disorders.</p><p><b>Moises Velasquez-Manoff</b> covered science and the environment for <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i>, and his work has appeared in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>,<i> The Chicago Tribune</i>, and <i>Slate</i>,<i> </i>among other publications.

The standard journalistic paraphernalia&#x2014;a digital recorder, camera, notepad, and pencils&#x2014;accompany me in the passenger seat, as well as directions to my meeting point: the last exit before Mexico. I also have a printout of my recent blood work, proof that I&#x2019;m not anemic, not infected with hepatitis or HIV&#x2014;that I&#x2019;m healthy enough for the coming experiment.<br> <br>As I drive, the radio announcer conducts a gruesome tally of the most recent violence in Tijuana, where I&#x2019;m headed: two bodies hung from a bridge, a third decapitated, a fourth shot. More than this terrible, ongoing brutality, however, parasites occupy my mind&#x2014;worms that migrate through flesh, burst into lungs, crawl down throats, and latch on to tender insides. Any traveler might fret over acquiring such hangers-on while abroad. But I&#x2019;m heading to Mexico precisely to obtain not just one, but a colony. Today in Tijuana I&#x2019;ll deliberately introduce the hookworm Necator americanus&#x2014;the American murderer&#x2014;into my body.<br> <br>And for this dubious honor, I&#x2019;ll pay handsomely&#x2014;a onetime fee of $2,300. If I receive twenty of the microscopic larvae, that&#x2019;s $115 apiece for a parasite that, in the early decades of the twentieth century, was considered a scourge on the American south. Some worried&#x2014;without condescension, I should add&#x2014;that hookworm was making southerners dim-witted and lazy, that it was socially and economically retarding half the country. And photos of poor, worm-ridden country folk from the time&#x2014;followed by their robust health after deworming&#x2014;clearly show the dire costs of necatoriasis, or hookworm disease: jutting collarbones, dull eyes, and listless expressions on wan faces. They appear as if consumed from the inside.<br> <br>Hookworm has mostly disappeared from the U.S., the result of protracted eradication efforts in the early twentieth century. But in the usually poor, tropical countries where it&#x2019;s still endemic, it can cause anemia, stunt growth, halt menstruation, and even retard mental development in growing children. Between 576 million and 740 million people carry the parasite. And for all the aforementioned reasons, public-health types consider worm infections a &#x201c;neglected tropical disease.&#x201d; Helminths, as they&#x2019;re called, are not as obviously fatal as malaria, say, but their constant drag on vitality is insidious. The parasites keep children from learning in school. They prevent parents from working. Some argue that they contribute to the self-reinforcing cycles of poor health and poverty that plague entire nations.<br> <br>So why am I considering acquiring this terrible creature? Scientists have two minds about parasites these days. Some consider them evil incarnate, but others note that while the above-mentioned horrors are sometimes true, the majority of humans infected with parasites today&#x2014;upward of 1.2 billion people, or somewhere between one-fifth and one-sixth of humanity&#x2014;host worms with few apparent symptoms. This camp has begun to suspect that worms may, in fact, confer some benefits on their human hosts.<br> <br>As early as the 1960s, by which time hookworm had been largely eradicated in the U.S., scientists puzzled over the lack of symptoms in some. &#x201c;Well-nourished persons often harbor helminths without apparent damage,&#x201d; remarked one physician in 1969.2 &#x201c;One may question the wisdom of treating such infections, especially with chemotherapeutic agents with toxic qualities.&#x201d;<br> <br>Decades of plumbing the mechanisms that allow one creature to persist within another, a clear violation of the self-versus-nonself rules thought to govern immune functioning, has taught immunologists much not only about how wily worms really are, but also about how the human immune system actually works. Parasites like hookworm were ubiquitous during our evolution. Might our bodies anticipate their presence in some respects, require it even? And might some of the more curious ailments of modernity result partly from their absence?<br> <br>That brings me to my motive: A large and growing body of science indicates that parasites may prevent allergic and autoimmune diseases. And I&#x2019;ve got both.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>When I was eleven, my hair began falling out. My grandmother first noticed it. I was visiting my grandparents at their beach house that summer when, one afternoon, she called me over, examined the back of my head, and proclaimed that I had a nickel-sized bald spot. Then we all promptly forgot about it. With the sand, waves, and sun beckoning, it just didn&#x2019;t seem that important.<br> <br>But by the time school started a few months later, the bald patch had grown. A dermatologist diagnosed alopecia areata, an autoimmune disorder. My immune system, normally tasked with protecting against invaders, had inexplicably mistaken friend for foe, and attacked my hair follicles. Scientists didn&#x2019;t know what, exactly, triggered alopecia, but stress was thought to play a role. And at first glance, that made sense. My parents were in the middle of a messy, drawn-out divorce. I was also beginning at a new junior high school that fall; I had, it seemed, much to worry about.<br> <br>I also had other, better-known immune-mediated problems. I suffered from fairly severe asthma as a child, and food allergies to peanuts, sesame, and eggs. (Only the egg allergy eventually disappeared.) At least once yearly, usually during seasons of high pollen count, my wheezing became so severe that my lips and fingernails turned blue, and my parents had to rush me to the emergency room. There, doctors misted me with bronchodilators, or, during severe attacks, pumped me full of immune-suppressing steroids.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aha!&#x201d; said the dermatologist when he learned of these other conditions. There was a correlation among allergies, asthma, and alopecia, he explained. No one was sure why or what it meant, but having an allergic disease like asthma increased one&#x2019;s chances of developing alopecia.<br> <br>Years later, I would learn that the co-occurrence of these two disorders was likely evidence of a single, root malfunction. But at age eleven, I accepted on faith that where one problem arose, so, probably, would others. So what to do? Given my age and the relatively small size of the bald spot, the doctor recommended watching and waiting. Alopecia usually corrected itself in time, he said. So we waited.<br> <br>In a month, another bald spot appeared, on the right side of my head. Then one on the left. Seemingly overnight, a large one opened up just above the middle of my forehead. As more hairless patches appeared, the pace at which new ones emerged accelerated. Every morning, my mother combed and gelled my hair into place to hide the growing expanse of denuded skin; but soon, concealing my bare scalp became nearly impossible. The spots began to converge. I was going bald.<br> <br>We returned to the dermatologist. This time, he had a less upbeat assessment. The more the disease progressed, he noted, the less likely recovery. The odds worked like this: Only 1 to 2 percent of the population got alopecia areata at all, a bald spot or two that, after a time, usually filled in again.3 But for a significant minority, maybe 7 percent of those with alopecia areata, the hair loss became chronic. Some progressed to alopecia totalis, total loss of hair on the head. At that point, the chances of a full recovery diminished substantially. Whatever mistake the immune system had made, it became permanent. And of this totalis subset, some went on to develop alopecia universalis&#x2014;loss of hair on the entire body. For them, recovery was nearly impossible.<br> <br>None of this sounded good, especially as I was speeding toward totalis and&#x2014;who knows?&#x2014;universalis after that. Two treatment options existed, neither of which worked without fail: immune suppression or irritation. Steroids suppressed the immune response and, basically, called off the attack dogs, allowing hair to grow again. Immune stimulation, on the other hand, worked in slightly more mysterious ways. Inflammation induced by an irritant distracted the immune system from less pressing projects, such as attacking hair follicles. Irritation would earn my hair follicles a reprieve. As neither approach was a sure bet, the dermatologist recommended that I try both.<br> <br>I did, and neither worked&#x2014;although I developed an oozing blister where I applied the irritant. My alopecia advanced until, by age sixteen, not a single hair remained on my body. I had joined the elite ranks, somewhere around 0.1 percent of the population, of those with alopecia universalis. I put on a hat, which I&#x2019;d wear more or less nonstop until my early twenties, and tried to get on with my adolescence.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Not until my thirties did I look into what scientists had discovered in the roughly twenty years since that first bald spot appeared on my head. I wasn&#x2019;t too hopeful; surely, I would have heard had a cure been developed. As I contemplated having children, I&#x2019;d begun fretting about what lay hidden in my genes. The first genome-wide association study of alopecia, published in 2010, showed that the disorder, the most common autoimmune disease in the U.S., shared gene variants with several much worse autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, type-1 diabetes, and celiac disease.4 Soon thereafter, my first child, a girl, arrived. Now the results of my investigation had concrete applications. If alopecia suggested a tendency toward immune malfunction, and if that tendency was modifiable, I wanted to know how to better play the cards. I wanted to ensure that my progeny remained free of both allergic and autoimmune disease.<br> <br>I was right about one thing. Treatments for alopecia hadn&#x2019;t advanced much since my childhood. They still consisted mainly of irritants and immune suppressants, and as neither approach corrected the underlying malfunction, both would require indefinite use. Prolonged exposure raised a host of secondary concerns. Repeated steroid shots, for example, were not only exceptionally painful, they thinned and discolored the skin. Irritants induced swelling, redness, and skin flaking. One powerful immune suppressant called cyclosporine increased the risk of skin cancer. No thanks.<br> <br>However, the patterns of immune-mediated disease in general caught my attention. The incidence of both autoimmune and allergic diseases had recently increased, and to the degree that scientific literature conveys feeling, in this case it evinced alarm. Scientists threw around the word epidemic to describe the rising prevalence of asthma especially, a descriptor usually reserved for infectious diseases, like the prayer-inducing, body-wasting, dead-in-a-day cholera epidemics that terrified the world during the nineteenth century. Generally speaking, however, there was no asthma bacterium, no autoimmune virus. No new plagues were driving this particular pandemic. Instead, we seemed newly vulnerable to immune dysfunction.<br> <br>If I possessed glasses that afforded me the power to see otherwise non-apparent allergic and autoimmune diseases, I&#x2019;d be struck by the sheer abundance of people with these problems. Walking down Broadway in New York City, for instance, one of every ten children passing by would have asthma; one in six would have an itchy rash and sometimes blisters&#x2014;eczema.5 One of every five passersby would have hay fever. If I could see allergic antibodies directly&#x2014;immunoglobulin-E&#x2014;I&#x2019;d note that half the crowd around me was sensitized to dust mites, tree pollen, and peanuts, among other basically harmless proteins. I&#x2019;d see pockets full of inhalers, and bags stuffed with allergy medicines. In the satchels of the most severely afflicted, I&#x2019;d see pills of powerful immune suppressants, such as prednisone. I&#x2019;d even see a few soon-to-be corpses; about 3,500 people die yearly from asthma attacks.<br> <br>Americans spend perhaps $10 billion yearly on asthma-related drugs and doctor visits. Direct and indirect costs of asthma combined reach about $56 billion. I&#x2019;d see these funds flowing from allergic and asthmatic wallets to doctors and drug companies. And I&#x2019;d observe money not flowing from days missed at work, diminished overall productivity, and opportunities lost over a lifetime.<br> <br>If I took the same walk with glasses that allowed me to see autoimmune diseases, I&#x2019;d note that one in twenty passersby had one of eighty of these often debilitating conditions.6 One of every 250 people&#x2014;it would take about a minute standing in a place like Times Square for such a person to pass by&#x2014;would suffer from debilitating pain in his or her intestines, what&#x2019;s called inflammatory bowel disease.7 I&#x2019;d see scarring and constriction. And in the most severe cases, I&#x2019;d observe removed lengths of intestine, colostomies (surgically created exits for intestinal contents), and colostomy bags (containers for the effluence) hidden under clothes.<br> <br>Of every thousand passersby, I&#x2019;d note one struggling to move legs or arms. These people have multiple sclerosis, a progressive autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Their vision might blur when they read signs. Their legs might fail to cooperate when crossing the street. The worst cases, of course, wouldn&#x2019;t be out at all. They&#x2019;d remain at home, perhaps in electric wheelchairs, maybe bedridden.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d note glucose monitors on one of every three hundred children frolicking in Central Park&#x2019;s playgrounds, children afflicted with autoimmune diabetes, which is usually childhood-onset.8 Their skin would bear needle marks from the daily insulin injections required to avoid coma and death.<br> <br>If my glasses came with headphones, I&#x2019;d hear a cacophony of worry and desperation: asthmatic teenagers wondering if they&#x2019;ll be able to join friends in a game of baseball; more severe cases focused on walking slowly, so as not to lose breath; eczematics reminding themselves ceaselessly not to scratch, or if they&#x2019;ve already scratched, berating themselves for the raw mess left behind.<br> <br>Those with inflammatory bowel disease might be preoccupied with the pain, sometimes dull, sometimes sharp, that has characterized life since diagnosis. If it&#x2019;s not racking cramps on their minds, they&#x2019;ll likely be strategizing around bowel movements, which arrive all too frequently and with a painful urgency, and which sometimes contain blood. Those with MS might be wondering: How much longer before I can&#x2019;t walk? And everyone will regularly ask: Why can&#x2019;t doctors fix this? Where did this come from? Why me?<br> <br>The National Institutes of Health estimate that between 14.7 and 23.5 million Americans have an autoimmune disease, or 5 to 8 percent of the population. The American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association puts the number at more than double that&#x2014;50 million Americans. In the U.S., autoimmune disease ranks among the top ten killers of women. And that speaks to an omission I made for simplicity&#x2019;s sake in the above scenario. Roughly three-quarters of those afflicted with autoimmune disease are female. When I had my autoimmune glasses on, in other words, I&#x2019;d be seeing mostly women.<br> <br>Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, once estimated that the direct and indirect costs of au...</p><h2>The Gift to Listen, the Courage to Hear</h2><p>The Gift to Listen, the Courage to Hear interweaves listening techniques with spiritual principles that emphasize the importance of listening and provide a framework for more effective listening.

She deserves an outstanding book. And now she has one." &#x2015;Waldemar Januszczak, Art Critic, <em>The Sunday Times</em></strong></p><p>A prolific painter and printmaker, Paula Rego is an artist of astonishing power with a unique and unforgettable aesthetic. Capturing the extraordinary aspects of Rego&#x2019;s work, author Deryn Rees-Jones places autobiographical narratives alongside stories suggested by Rego&#x2019;s pictures. She explores their rich and textured layering of references to the old masters, fiction, fairytales, poems, the folk traditions of Rego&#x2019;s native Portugal, politics, feminism, and more. The result is a highly original work that addresses urgent and topical questions on gender, subject and object, and self and other.</p><p>Taking its cues from the artist, this fascinating study invites us to reflect on the complexities of storytelling. Rooted in close interpretation of the artworks, we see how Rego&#x2019;s art intersects with the work of other women artists, such as Cindy Sherman and Louise Bourgeois, as well as writers, from Charlotte Bronte� and Angela Carter to Franz Kafka and Martin McDonagh.</p><p>A definitive volume on the artist&#x2019;s oeuvre, <em>Paula Rego</em> continues to raise questions, elevating it beyond a retrospective to something both provocative and authoritative.</p> 350 illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Deryn Rees-Jones&nbsp;</strong>is a writer and academic, whose poetry has received numerous critical accolades, including shortlisting for the T.

Once a bustling and dignified ancestral estate, now all that remains is the ch�teau's gruff, elderly owner and the softly whispered secrets of generations buried and forgotten.<br>&nbsp;<br>But time has a way of exposing history's dark stains, and when American photographer Cady Drake finds herself drawn to the ch�teau and its antique carousel, she longs to explore the relic's shadowy origins beyond the small scope of her freelance assignment.

The cats, dogs, pigs, and rabbits were carved, painted, and gilded in Bayol&#x2019;s factory in Angers, but it has taken nine men to transport the pieces by rail, then by steam traction engine from the station to the ch�teau, and then to assemble the machine on-site. It will take another two weeks, perhaps a month, to complete the elaborately decorated salon that will house the carousel.</p><p>Josephine wishes it would take longer. She would be happy if they stayed forever. Especially the carver&#x2019;s apprentice.</p><p>She and the apprentice have placed confidence in each other; they will keep each other&#x2019;s confidences.</p><p>Josephine knows her neighbors think of her as secretive and scheming because she was not born here. She comes from faraway Bretagne, and yet she stole the heart of their local favorite, the eligible Yves Paul Clement, heir to Ch�teau Clement. Bretagne and Provence were meant to be part of France now, but deep-seated regional stereotypes and allegiances do not respect random borders.</p><p>She understands. After all, before Yves brought her to Ch�teau Clement as a young bride, Josephine had always believed the Proven�al people to be lazy, unfriendly, and afflicted with a harsh accent.</p><p>She has found the accent and unfriendliness to be apt, but though her husband is accustomed to taking a sieste every afternoon, he is anything but lazy. Yves rises early to capture the light of dawn on his camera; he works late into the night in his darkroom. He is an educated gentleman: He reads in his library, he composes poetry, he draws. Unlike most in the region, he does not hunt. Instead, he observes and makes note of the birds that perch on the limbs of the plane trees and olive orchards: the short-toed lark and tawny pipit in spring, the red-crested pochard and moustached warbler in fall.</p><p>Yves&#x2019;s keen eyes observe the forest creatures, the turning of the leaves, the changing quality of the light throughout the day, throughout the seasons. By virtue of the incessant clicking of his cameras, he records the world around him.</p><p>And yet, he does not see.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Present day</p><p>Oakland</p><p>Cady Anne Drake</p><p>Cady had never realized how many empty platitudes people voiced when confronted with grief, how they felt compelled to say something, to say anything, in response to a situation that had no answer, no response. No solution.</p><p>In point of brutal fact, there was nothing to say. Maxine had died.</p><p>One moment she was there, Cady&#x2019;s ever-present rock in the shifting sands of life. And the next she had fallen to the floor behind the register, struck down by a sudden heart attack. Maxine had disappeared into the ether, just like that, along with her snarky comments and wise eyes and calm, slightly haughty demeanor that never failed to assuage Cady&#x2019;s inner demons. She was gone. No one else in this life would be lucky enough to know Maxine Caroline Clark.</p><p>All that remained of the old woman was her shop, called Maxine&#x2019;s Treasures, its junky (or artsy, depending on your perspective) inventory, and the back room, where Cady had set up her photography studio and darkroom. Even though Cady had no intention of taking over and managing Maxine&#x2019;s antiques store, she wasn&#x2019;t ready to give up her studio. Not to mention that she&#x2019;d been living in the back room of the shop&#x2014;which was not strictly legal&#x2014;since she&#x2019;d lost her relatively affordable apartment to a condo development several months ago.</p><p>What now? Where would she go? What would she do?</p><p>Maxine was family. She was all Cady had.</p><p>A desperate, breathless weariness reached out its icy fingers to grip Cady&#x2019;s bones. And it wasn&#x2019;t the strain of carrying her wooden carousel figure, Gus. She saw reproach in the rabbit&#x2019;s glass eyes as she maneuvered him into the shop; could this last shred of hope gone be her comeuppance for having tried to sell him?</p><p>Maxine had given Gus to her ten years ago, on Cady&#x2019;s wedding day. The marriage hadn&#x2019;t lasted long, and the only thing Cady took from it&#x2014;besides bitter experience&#x2014;was Gus-the-rabbit.</p><p>It was embarrassing to admit, but Gus had always made her feel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. loved.</p><p>According to Maxine, Gus was a genuine piece of carousel history, hand-carved by the famous French sculptor Gustave Bayol. Which would have meant he was worth thousands&#x2014;maybe tens of thousands. But this morning Cady&#x2019;s last-ditch financial dreams had been dashed by an earnest young man named Scott Ripley. Peering through a huge magnifying glass, the Antique Forum&#x2019;s acknowledged expert in nineteenth- and twentieth-century European carvings had examined the rabbit&#x2019;s loosening joints, noting how the bands of basswood had pulled away from one another at the tops of the legs, and the gap where the neck section met the body. Carousel figures are hollow, built like boxes with slats of wood joined, laminated, then carved, and primed to conceal the joints. Not only were the sections falling apart&#x2014;Gus&#x2019;s ears were now barely connected to his slightly tilted head&#x2014;but the bright paint and gold gilding were flaking off, with gesso primer showing through in patches.</p><p>At long last Ripley had straightened, shrugged, and pronounced: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a Bayol.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wrong,&#x201d; Cady said. &#x201c;Look again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your rabbit is most probably European, and from Bayol&#x2019;s era, at the turn of the twentieth century. In some ways, it is very much in his style; Bayol carved farmyard animals with sweet expressions like this one, so that fits. But a hallmark of Bayol&#x2019;s carvings was their simplicity. His work almost never included flourishes like the lily of the valley here,&#x201d; he said, pointing to the offending flower. &#x201c;And this rose carved in high relief, with the detailed thorns? I don&#x2019;t even know what to say about that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But Bayol did custom work, right?&#x201d; Cady replied. &#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t a client have asked for the flowers?&#x201d;</p><p>He shook his head. &#x201c;I know Bayol&#x2019;s work well; I&#x2019;m also very familiar with the American carvers Dentzel, Looff, and Carmel. Like all artists, carousel carvers leave their imprints on their work, like signatures. Also, Bayol nearly always attached a small plaque to the saddles of his carved animals, and yours doesn&#x2019;t have one. Your rabbit might have been carved by one of Bayol&#x2019;s apprentices, or a competitor&#x2014;if you could establish its provenance, it would be worth more.&#x201d;</p><p>Cady&#x2019;s impulse was to argue with Ripley, to rail at him and cast aspersions on his professional qualifications, not to mention his parentage.</p><p>But it wasn&#x2019;t his fault. Maxine had been wrong. It wasn&#x2019;t surprising: Maxine always had insisted upon seeing possibilities in the junk other people threw away.</p><p>So Cady had concentrated on reining in her emotions, fighting an almost overwhelming, and wholly uncharacteristic, urge to burst into tears.</p><p>Get it together, Drake, she had scolded herself. We&#x2019;ve been in worse situations than this one. Much, much worse. We&#x2019;ll just have to come up with another plan.</p><p>As a child Cady had developed the quirk of using the royal &#x201c;we&#x201d; when talking to herself; otherwise the only &#x201c;we&#x201d; in her world was wishful thinking. Later, the &#x201c;we&#x201d; came to mean Cady and Maxine, and finally, now, Cady and Gus-the-rabbit. It was a silly, childish habit, but Cady had more important things to worry about these days, such as where she was going to get the money to escape the wildly expensive San Francisco Bay Area, to move to a town where normal people could work a regular job and afford a decent place to live, and where she could become a foster mom, or maybe even adopt a child. The thought of change terrified her, but she was desperate to create the sort of family that she&#x2019;d always wanted for herself. True, being a photographer wasn&#x2019;t the best career option in a small town, but she didn&#x2019;t care what she did for a living. She wasn&#x2019;t proud.</p><p>The important thing was to start over. To reinvent herself. Cady yearned for the anonymity of a second chance, a clean slate, a tabula rasa. To make a home someplace where no one knew where she came from, where no one knew she had nothing and no one.</p><p>No family connections, no Maxine, no&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. baby.</p><p>Without volition her hand went to her stomach. The only bump there now was from stress-eating her way through countless bags of potato chips and boxes of Petit �colier cookies&#x2014;scraping off the chocolate in an embarrassingly juvenile ritual&#x2014;as she sat on the couch for weeks, watching endless reruns of Hoarders.</p><p>The nurse in the emergency room had smelled of antiseptic and was very nice in the impersonal way of a kindhearted person saddled with far too much to do. She had instructed Cady to finish the round of prophylactic antibiotics, to abstain from sex for six weeks (no problem there&#x2014;Cady couldn&#x2019;t imagine being intimate, ever again, with anyone), to get plenty of rest, and to be prepared for sudden hormonal shifts as her body adjusted to what her medical chart referred to as an &#x201c;SAB&#x201d;: spontaneous abortion.</p><p>The baby Cady had accidentally conceived in an exceedingly rare one-night stand, then after weeks of fear and trembling had decided to keep and come to love, had been lost in a gruesome rush of pain and cramps and blood, a gutting experience referred to simply as an SAB.</p><p>An SAB.</p><p>Cady&#x2019;s appalling, alien urge to cry must be due to shifting hormones. Nothing more. Surely.</p><p>First Maxine had died. Then Cady&#x2019;s own body had betrayed her. And now, even her precious carousel rabbit had turned out not to be who she&#x2019;d always thought he was.</p><p>Cady was on a merry-go-round, and no matter how fast she galloped, she kept winding up at the same place.</p><p>Her eyes stung, tears threatening. So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. okay. Maybe she would allow herself a few quick minutes of weeping in the back of the shop, while cursing Mr. Scott Ripley of the Antiques Forum and his so-called expertise.</p><p>Then she would come up with a new plan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Present day</p><p>Oakland</p><p>Cady</p><p>The banging on the door wouldn&#x2019;t stop. Cady had hung the Closed sign on the window of the shop door, alongside a note about Maxine&#x2019;s death. But some of Maxine&#x2019;s regular customers could be as persistent and annoying as a broken tooth.</p><p>&#x201c;Go away!&#x201d; she yelled from the back room.</p><p>The banging continued. She turned the television volume up.</p><p>&#x201c;Cady?&#x201d; A woman&#x2019;s voice. Olivia.</p><p>Cady often thought of Maxine as the only person in the world who loved her, but there was also Olivia Gray.</p><p>They had met years ago, right after Cady got divorced, in an adult education course on photography&#x2014;genuine, old-fashioned photography and film development, taught by a cranky old man who didn&#x2019;t take to what he called &#x201c;that modern digital crap.&#x201d;</p><p>Olivia was everything Cady wasn&#x2019;t but had always wanted to be: pretty, petite, quick to smile at others and to laugh at herself. It was the first time Cady had understood the concept of a girl crush; she was enamored, sneaking glances under her bangs during class, following Olivia out to the vending machines during break.</p><p>One night the machine ate Olivia&#x2019;s rumpled dollar. She banged on it ineffectually and yelled, &#x201c;Gol-darn it!&#x201d;</p><p>Cady had never heard anyone say something like that except on television.</p><p>&#x201c;Early training,&#x201d; Olivia explained to Cady, with an embarrassed smile and a chagrined little shrug. &#x201c;My mom&#x2019;s a stickler for polite language. If she gets really, really mad she might say, &#x2018;Dammit!&#x2019; But then she always follows it up with: &#x2018;Pardon my French!&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>Cady smiled, hitting the machine just so while reaching in the back, the way she had learned to do as a bad kid with no spending money. The mechanism started to hum and a PayDay bar banged down into the metal trough.</p><p>&#x201c;There you go.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks! That&#x2019;s a neat trick. So, what&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;</p><p>Olivia didn&#x2019;t even know her name? It figured. Stuck-up jerk.</p><p>But nipping at the heels of anger was shame: Try as she might, Cady just didn&#x2019;t pick up on social cues like other people did. She wondered whether it was something integral to her&#x2014;some mysterious bit of genetic code she had inherited from her unknown parents&#x2014;or if it derived from her detached, frenetic childhood. Ultimately it didn&#x2019;t matter. She had always known she wasn&#x2019;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. likable.</p><p>She turned on her heel and stalked back to the classroom.</p><p>After class, as Cady was gathering her things, Olivia made a beeline across the room. &#x201c;So, I&#x2019;m an idiot in general. And I can never remember names.&#x201d;</p><p>Cady shrugged and zipped up the battered leather backpack she had scored at the flea market for five dollars.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a bit of a sleuth, though. Not to mention stubborn,&#x201d; Olivia said, holding out her hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to officially meet you, Cady Drake. I&#x2019;m Olivia Gray. How do you do?&#x201d;</p><p>Cady stared at her hand for a beat.</p><p>&#x201c;Like I said, I know I&#x2019;m clueless,&#x201d; Olivia continued. &#x201c;But since we&#x2019;re the only two people in this class under the age of forty, I was wondering, do you want to go grab a drink?&#x201d;</p><p>Maxine&#x2019;s voice whispered in her mind: &#x201c;Get over yourself, girl. Don&#x2019;t assume everyone&#x2019;s out to get you.&#x201d;</p><p>So Cady nodded, and they stopped by George O&#x2019;s. It was a seedy dive bar, typical for this part of Oakland, but when they walked in, Olivia&#x2019;s eyes lit up like a child&#x2019;s on Christmas morning.</p><p>&#x201c;This is great,&#x201d; she announced, taking in the dartboard, out-of-date Halloween decorations, and half a dozen men slouched over the bar. She ordered bourbon on the rocks, and Cady did the same.</p><p>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Olivia said as they took their drinks to a table. &#x201c;&#x2018;Cady&#x2019; is a pretty name. I saw on the roster that you don&#x2019;t spell it the traditional way, K-A-T-Y.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; said Cady. &#x201c;I mean, I came with it.&#x201d;</p><p>Olivia smiled. &#x201c;I always hated my name.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The kids used to taunt me at school, calling me Olive Oyl,&#x201d; she said in a low voice, as though confiding a shameful secret.</p><p>&#x201c;Gee,&#x201d; said Cady after a beat, &#x201c;that must have been very traumatic for you.&#x201d;</p><p>Olivia looked surprised, then started laughing. &#x201c;You just made a joke! And here I thought you were serious all the time.&#x201d; She held up her glass. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s have a toast. To quote Humphrey Bogart in that movie: &#x2018;I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>And oddly enough, it was. After the photography class ended, they enrolled in French language courses, then Thai cooking, then botany. Olivia and her boyfriend, Sebastian, had Cady and Maxine over for dinner, and when they married, Cady stood up with them at City Hall. Olivia loved to tag along at antiques flea markets, asking questions, and furnishing her falling-down West Oakland Victorian one piece at a time. Eventually she landed a job at Sunset magazine, and steered the occasional freelance photography job Cady&#x2019;s way.</p><p>Through the years they joked about who had the upper hand in the &#x201c;Trauma O...</p></p><h2>Native Voices: Indigenous American Poetry, Craft and Conversations</h2><p>In this groundbreaking anthology of Indigenous poetry and prose, Native poems, stories, and essays are informed with a knowledge of both what has been lost and what is being restored.

Taking an irenic approach, Wright explains the key doctrines while also contrasting them with Arminianism. The accessible format allows readers to easily look up topics they're most interested in, including:<ul><li>What is the difference between Calvinism and the Reformed tradition?</li><li>Does God love all people?</li><li>What is predestination?</li><li>Did Jesus die for the sins of the whole world?</li><li>Can people resist the Holy Spirit?</li><li>Do Calvinists practice evangelism and missions?</li></ul><br><br>For Calvinists or those seeking to understand Calvinism better, <i>40 Questions About Calvinism</i> helps readers understand the key terms, issues, and debates of this highly influential theological viewpoint.</p><p>Shawn D. Wright is professor of church history at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and a pastor at Clifton Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky."Professor Shawn Wright has given us a good, reliable, readable, basic introduction to Calvinism, and some of the main questions that surround it. If you are a non-Calvinist seeking answers about Calvinism, you will find in this little book a clear and winsome presentation of the position, as well as a response to some key criticisms. If you are a Calvinist looking for a model of how to talk about these things with non-Calvinists, then you will find here a helpful and humble model for explaining the Calvinist position, and its points of disagreement with Arminianism, in a fair-minded, even-handed way. If you are seeking something that will help you to understand, summarize and explain these issues, you will find this book a welcome addition to your library. The biblical doctrines discussed in this book matter. They matter for our understanding of who God is, what he is like and what he has graciously done, and consequently for our humility, assurance, joy, worship and witness. So read and be edified, and give all the glory to God." (Ligon Duncan, Chancellor/CEO and Professor, Reformed Theological Seminary 2018-12-13)<br><br>"Shawn Wright&#x2019;s book on Calvinism is biblically rooted, theologically astute, historically informed, and pastorally shaped. Wright lucidly explains the tenets of Calvinism, answers common misconceptions about it, and refutes objections to Calvinist soteriology. Wright&#x2019;s book is the first book I would give to anyone with questions about Calvinism, for a pastoral, warm-hearted love for the gospel, missions, and holiness pervades this work. I recommend this work enthusiastically." (Thomas R. Schreiner, Professor and Associate Dean, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary 2018-12-13)<br><br>"How we make the greatness of God central in our thought and in how we see ourselves and our world is at the very heart of biblically shaped faith. Over the ages, Calvinists have pondered these matters very deeply. In this book, Wright explains what Calvinism stands for. It is a book that is informed and informative. It is lucid and forthright. And even when engaging ideas in conflict with Calvinistic beliefs it is fair and even gentle. It is a very commendable study." (David F. Wells, Distinguished Senior Research Professor, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary 2018-12-03)<br><br>"One of the most striking features of the writings of the Apostle Paul is his willingness to raise the most strenuous questions against his doctrine, and then to answer those questions fully and powerfully. This follows the same pattern seen perfectly in our Lord Jesus Christ, who took on all comers and answered their deepest questions. The same spirit of courageous truth-telling fills Shawn Wright&#x2019;s excellent volume, <i>40 Questions About Calvinism</i>. The questions raised are comprehensive and well-organized, and each one is addressed with a wonderful balance of thoroughness and clarity. This volume will prove a helpful tool to all people seeking to understand Calvinism, and, more importantly, biblical doctrine concerning God&#x2019;s sovereign actions in saving sinners." (Andy Davis, Senior Pastor of First Baptist Church, Durham, North Carolina 2018-12-03)<br><br>"This is a clear and thoughtful book that fairly represents and quotes from alternative viewpoints, contains much informative historical material, wisely counsels against common misunderstandings and misuses of Calvinist teaching, and ultimately presents a highly persuasive argument that what is commonly called &#x201c;Calvinism&#x201d; is, quite simply, the system of belief that is actually taught in the Bible from beginning to end." (Wayne Grudem, Distinguished Research Professor of Theology &amp; Biblical Studies,Phoenix Seminary 2018-12-03)<br><br>"For all those who want to understand what the Bible says about how we are saved, as well as the arguments surrounding that discussion, Shawn Wright has provided a valuable service. <i>40 Questions About Calvinism</i> provides both a clear and persuasive case for the sovereignty of God in salvation, and a helpful resource for specific questions raised by that fundamental truth. With clarity, brevity, accuracy, and always with an eye to pastoral relevancy, Dr. Wright addresses the major topics and objections to Calvinism. But the most pleasant surprise of the book, other than its positive and irenic tone, is the final section, aimed at encouraging Calvinists to be fruitful in gospel ministry because of, not in spite of, the doctrines of grace. This is a great book to hand to a church member with questions, or a young theology student in need of orientation. And it&#x2019;s a wonderful reminder to those of us long familiar with these doctrines that they are not only true, but beautiful, because they tend most to magnifying God&#x2019;s glory. I highly recommend it." (Michael Lawrence, Lead Pastor, Hinson Baptist Church, Portland, Oregon 2018-12-03)<br><br>"The resurgence of Calvinism today has necessitated a book that painstakingly answers the many honest questions that are being asked about it. Thankfully, this book answers such questions with biblical and historical fidelity. Here is a book to put into the hands of such enquirers whose understanding of Calvinism may have been formed by those who caricature it. The fact that each chapter is a question helps enquirers go straight to the issue that is dogging them. Shawn Wright&#x2019;s book will also help young Calvinists to better understand and express the historic theological position they espouse&#x2015;to the glory of God!" (Conrad Mbewe, Pastor at Kabwata Baptist Church, Lusaka, Zambia 2018-12-03)<br><br>"This book is an excellent introduction to Calvinism by a seasoned scholar, Shawn Wright. Those looking for a solid overview of Calvinistic soteriology that is scholarly yet clear and accessible will find it here. Despite the obvious disagreements I as an Arminian have with Wright&#x2019;s Calvinistic theology, I highly recommend this erudite and well-written volume for those who want to gain a fuller understanding of the Calvinistic system of thought."

At its heart the movement bears witness to a contemporary experience of divine-human encounter in line with the prophetic claims of the Old Testament and the Pentecost testimony of the New&#x2014;indeed an encounter with the power/the presence/the Spirit of God that is radically transformative enough, at both personal and corporate levels, to evoke a new way of seeing the world and, with it, a new way of reading the Word. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In the post-modern situation that has forced all of us to a greater awareness of the contextual particularities of how we see and read things, with all of the limitation and the illumination that this can entail, it is time for offering a survey of Scripture, and the Old Testament in particular, that speaks both from and to the manifold global context of Pentecostal faith and practice.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here the authors are deft guides, affirming the integration of academic scholarship and charismatic spirituality. They present thoughtful readers with an overview of the Old Testament that is explicitly engaged with the faith and practice of the Pentecostal movement and the recent scholarship that has been generated by this contemporary, global, Christian movement, especially as it bears upon biblical interpretation. They invite readers to approach scripture reading with the expectation of being encountered and addressed by a Living Voice, flipping the primary goal of biblical study from &#x2018;us interpreting Scripture&#x2019; to &#x2018;Scripture reading and interpreting us.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br> In addition to treating each Old Testament book individually, this textbook offers a brief chapter-length introduction to each of the four major book collections, as standardized in the Protestant Bible&#x2019;s arrangement of Old Testament Scriptures: 1) Pentateuch; 2) Historical Books; 3) Poetical Books; and 4) Prophets.<br></p><p>Rickie D.
